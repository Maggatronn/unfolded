      "words": "All right. First, the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive city. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build the connection and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become a part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the other conservations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with the members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations like DLC in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across different conversations and allow users to search, listen to audio snippets, and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. This is the consent part. I'm going to read the consent and ask everyone verbal consent at the end. Okay. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is completely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected, and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree, please say, I agree.",

I want to give everyone the space to share and learn from others, and to support that we'll have a few guidelines. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions of each other. Pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And then I'll add the zoom guideline. Just take space and get off camera if you need to save bandwidth, that's totally okay after our introductions. Does anyone think there should be another guideline to add? Nope. Okay. All right. We're going to take our time to do introductions, and then there will be a couple of community-based questions afterwards. Please share just your first name or a nickname that you want to be referred by. If you would like, completely optional, share your pronouns. And what we're looking for is a story, how you came to the Boston area. Have you moved yourself to the area or was it your family? Were you already raised here? What brought you here, and what was the experience like? I can model, my name is Caitlin. My pronouns are they and she. I, on my dad's side, am third generation Bostonian. His family came from Ireland at different points of time. My mom grew up outside of Chicago, also an immigrant family. He was out there for a job and they married and moved back to Boston. I grew up in one of the neighborhoods in the city pretty much all my life. Would anyone like to start us off and go first?",

I have needed a wheelchair for a long time, wasn't able to get one until earlier this year. And one of the first things that I did after being able to leave my house was a political action where a group of people, we, I guess, occupied a building to keep it from being evicted. And it was a moment in time that only ended up lasting maybe two or three days, but where I was living, physically living in a space that was completely controlled and organized by just the people living there. We didn't have a landlord that we were... We were building this living space for ourselves. And the level of... There's just so many little things about living with a disability that when I was in that space and in that building where if I couldn't make food for myself, somebody else was happily going to do it. And people were constantly being really hyper aware of everyone's accessibility needs and where I felt like I had a lot to offer. People were really... I felt very, these were strangers also, I felt like my strengths, which are not physical, but more interpersonal and organizational. I haven't been in a living situation where those are the things that are valued because yeah, I can't do the chores, but because it was part of this bigger project, there were tons of other things that I could do. And I felt really, I guess just worthy of being there. And my physical symptoms also just almost completely went away while I was in that space, which I don't know if that's attributable to having consistent food and rest or the more emotional aspects of it or some combination. But yeah, I think that when you ask when is a time that I felt supported by my community, that's what comes to my head. Yeah.",

It is looked at as a problem that is chronic, for which there's no intervention, which really doesn't give credit to the people who have it because I know I'm trying to improve my life every day. On top of it, I have depression and anxiety, and I have my whole life. I believe that when I was working, a lot of aspects to my job were not compatible with a person who has ADHD. And even though I worked with other people who were knowledgeable and familiar with ADD or ADHD, an attentive type, there was no acknowledgement or support around it. It was, oh, you are an employee, you work here and you are broken. It's not our job to fix you, but instead we have the option of renewing your contract and we decide we are not going to. There's not a lot of... I mean, I'm questioning how to approach this issue in my next job and I can only hope that it doesn't work against me. But I found that there is support in a lot of unexpected places. Places that you would want support would be at work and in your emotional life. But I found people are incredibly generous with their possessions, and you'll find them online. People are giving things away that are in perfectly good condition. You'll see them when you're on a walk or driving to work. And that really tells me something about people here because yes, people financially for the most part, seem to be doing really well. They're still considering that there might be people who are not quite in their same situation, even though it feels like that. It really feels like that, that you're the only one who's not rich or something. But what sticks out to me about that is that other people want you to enjoy something that they've enjoyed. Thank you.",

      "words": "I could go. Going back to my moving again situation. Being disabled, my disability is a genetic one. I was diagnosed, took 20 years diagnosed, there's no cure, no treatment, just connect the lines to get the symptoms. And I had to stop work. I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \"Normal people,\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that. You have to find different outlets and the frustration of that. It's just very, very difficult and trying to survive on that. It's very stressful.",

The first thing that I wanted to do was actually try to turn the first floor into an accessible apartment because as everybody knows, especially back in the '90s, there was very limited accessible housing and just hit roadblock after roadblock with the city of Boston that we weren't able to do it. And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \"increase\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\" And their response to me is, \"Why do you need it?\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it. And I just find that there's so many roadblocks. And I'm fortunate because English is my first language. I'm educated, I work in social services. I'm a citizen, so I don't have to worry about speaking up because somebody might report me. I'm white. I have so much privilege and yet still nothing, very little changes. For West Roxbury now there's, I even measured, there's 0.2 miles where there's not one on street accessible parking space and there used to be two in that area and have tried going through all sorts of avenues and nothing happens. Tried contacting the mayor's office, that was useless. Wouldn't even get a call back.",

It's interesting because for example, when I lived out in Western Mass, I lived in Amherst and the downtown area of Amherst had an apartment building that was subsidized and had people that were older and then people with disabilities and they did a major renovation of the post office but didn't put in a ramp. And by law you're required to put in a ramp if you do a certain percentage of a thing. And I contacted them and they said... And then got nowhere. Then I decided that you can actually file a complaint in the government and in writing so then they have to respond. And then the response to me was, \"Well, the post office outside of town is accessible.\" And I'm like, \"Yes, but first of all, people don't live out there. And also they have to take a bus and then there's an hour before the next bus comes.\" And a few times people would say to me, \"Do you mind mailing this or doing that kind of stuff?\" And I didn't mind do it, but they have a right to have privacy and they're giving me their money and trusting. I did the bitchy thing of going up the food chain and there's now actually accessible, there's now a ramp. At first they said they couldn't put one in. I'm like, \"Yes, you can.\" I actually told them where you could put it, and now that's actually where the ramp is. But it shouldn't be that hard.",

      "words": "Yeah, well I think in this similar way as Jen, I've also been proactive about my problem. It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions. But at that second job, I wasn't going to tell them directly that I had any neurological psychiatric issues because I knew what happened the last time I did that.",

I actually about that's 10 years ago was working in a hospital and then was out for a period of time because of disability. It's about the time that I became pretty severely disabled. And asked for reasonable accommodations that actually wouldn't cost the hospital one penny and just denied them and then let go. The hospital got a slap on the wrist. But it took me quite a few years to find a job that I could be successful in and with the disability, and actually I do it now and do it, I think well, but I make less than half of what I made 10 years ago and that's a big issue. And I'm very fortunate because although my wife and I separated, she's still in my life and helps me a lot and helps me some financially. And we agreed to stay married because I need the health insurance. And I agree with what Jack said about putting back into the community. I mentioned that we were lucky enough that we were able to buy a three family and we've tried to keep it because it's always been really important to us that we help people out. It's in JP and we charge 1,500 for a three bedroom because it's important to me that people have affordable housing. But actually with the whole proposal of the rent control with the mayor, the way they've worked it, we would actually probably end up having to sell. And we're not the only ones, small landlords were originally going to be protected and kind of have some benefits and that was taken away by the mayor. Now there's a lot of people like us who are probably going to end up needing to sell. And we didn't intentionally set out, but one of the people that we rented to lived there for 13 years and transitioned, identified as transgender and transitioned. And since then we rent by word of mouth. Now we have our house happens to be right now totally LGBTQA with two floors being people who identifies transgender and one who identifies as lesbian.",

      "words": "Going back to housing and stuff, I think it's very, very difficult for anyone disabled and just the society we live in now. We have to be compared with regular normal people. It makes it really, really difficult for us to thinking, is it just us or is it them? We talked about making a buck. Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \"Oh, I do Section 8.\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \"Oh, you don't look it,\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too. But it's difficult to survive on that when people had the mind frame of thinking that. Thank you.",

Now I can't do that and have to pay somebody to do it for me, but it's really an issue of we've made some improvements and I think the tea has gotten better, but the tea got better because they got sued and so they had to implement a program. It's like why does it have to come to that? And health insurance is a big issue. I mean I'm very fortunate that because I have a lot of medical issues that my wife is willing to stay legally married to me even though she's in a relationship with somebody else, but stay legally married to me so that I can have the health insurance. But it shouldn't be that way. Health insurance should be somewhat affordable and it's not at all. Even with the Connector that we have, I know a lot of people that get health insurance to the Connector and they have either really high deductibles or really high premiums if they have any kind of medical issue.

      "words": "Well I have something say about that. Probably before I became disabled I actually became independent about my own insurance. Actually it has changed. It changed over time. The reason why I did that was because I want to be an independent therapist, social worker. I did so many years under other facilities and corporate, I didn't like it. I went from management to individual to group everything in between and different jobs. I didn't like it that I was willing to pay on my own pocket to get it, but it actually got much better within 10 years. And this was like 30 years ago. If you're... I was telling a friend that is actually going through a job, he actually... There is a stigma regarding about mental health. I met him 30 years ago. He's around how old I am. And he had a meltdown, that's how we didn't work out for us. And he was working there and he actually lost a job, but he never had any issues later on and stuff. There is a stigma there, but now he's been looking for a job. There's a discrimination also with being older too. Getting a job, he's been in out of jobs for the last two years and stuff and it's been really difficult and struggling that being a man and being Asian, old-fashioned style, the culture really makes emphasis input on it. Whitney, it's not anyone here it's just unfortunately the world we live in is just making a buck for them right now. And they do every three months to change over because they don't want to pay insurance, they don't want to pay people vacation, don't give them comp time. And there's so many people out there out of work that don't want to work for themselves because the governments not helping them anymore. Basically as I noticed, because I go on different Zooms helping people out throughout town, different countries, and different states. I know it's somewhat still going on and stuff. I have few patients myself, I still see and do things. But yes, it's not the very friendly world we live in now. Everyone's just to themselves doing things. It's been more difficult with people that are disabled and stuff by the way of doing things or going through the process of it. I have a friend that is actually, she is in the process of trying find disability on herself and finding housing at the same time. And she's Caucasian and she's in her 30s and she's struggling a lot and she doesn't want to get a lawyer because she still wants to work and she works for children. The battle, idea of being a female and she has a pet too, companionship. Having that struggle to figure things out, I still have to give everything. When I came to say I have to give everything for a whole entire year and it took me four times to get and stuff. It's very difficult to people, the way I was trying to help her find a place to live too and stuff while I was doing. It's hard for anyone being disabled or in the process of coming disabled. Distinguishing and not feeling guilty about what you... Thank you.",

      "words": "Okay, so first, the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across the neighborhoods and communities to build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve that, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared by the members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the City of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as MIT CCC. Thirdly, all conversations that were part of our effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed... Just go into here. There we go. That is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, CCC's deployment team. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. Now, the verbal consent part. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have that recording data deleted. Only the research team at the MI CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"",

I want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we will introduce a few guidelines for the conversation. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions. Pause as in, take time for reflection and listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have impact. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that comes out that you would like to add or tweak? Okay. One thing that's not on here, because it's a guide for every conversation, I will say, since we are on Zoom and being on camera can get very tiring at times, if you need to save your bandwidth for another meeting or you're just feeling you need some space, feel free to put your camera off. The recording part that we need is the audio, not the video. So if everyone is okay, I'm going to kick ourselves off with a round of quick introductions. Please just share what name you want to use, you're comfortable with, your pronouns, if you're comfortable, and what about your journey to Boston. If you have moved here, what brought yourself to the city? If you have been here with family here for a while, what brought your family here and what was coming to Boston like for them or for yourself?",

I'm part of an IEP team.\" And I just felt really supported in that moment. But I didn't know if you... I'm realizing you meant supported in your disability or... Oh, just in general. Okay.

After my last relationship, getting to know a bunch of other people who just so happened to both be queer and neurodivergent has been great. That's not part of the co-op requirements. It just happened that way and everyone has been so kind. It's been nice to rebuild friendships outside of a romantic context. And then also, the house itself is very old and not very accessible, but everyone has worked with me in so many ways to make it as accessible as possible. For example, we have these old crystal beveled doorknobs that hurt my hands quite a bit when I use them. Ooh, it hurts. And I found silicon covers for them on Amazon and the facilities' manager, without even questioning it, just ordered them for me and then ordered an extra set for my bathroom without me even thinking about it. So yeah, just small things like that have made living in an inaccessible building a lot easier and it's just been very nice.",

I was in mental health, but then also I worked in the restaurant industry for 13 years and I was working there when I became incredibly sick. I have autonomic dysfunction and the restaurant industry is not accessible at all ever. I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\" I'm like, \"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs.

So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled.

Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \"Oh, you know we have cameras,\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\" And other people are like, \"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\" or, \"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\" So I worry about that.

      "words": "Oh, I can share. I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

Even Blue Hill Ave. right now has luxury apartments, which is not in a bad way, but just the amount of development that is completely out of touch with the populations of the areas that it is in and it is completely out of touch with the needs of Bostonians at this moment. I think housing, if you don't have a solid foundation, everything else is going to feel shaky. And I definitely think the housing market here... I've lived in the same place happily for the most part for the last 15 plus years, but I am over housed. The only alternative to that is to tell my college age daughter who is paying for all of that on her own, that she has to move out and get 72 roommates in a three bedroom, fifth floor walkup in Allston, or she's got to pay $3,000 a month to live on her own, or she's got to pay $18,000 a year to live on campus.

So unfortunately, the Zoom link that I gave you is set for an hour timer, and we have eight minutes left. If you would humor me, I would like to stop this meeting because we have one more question that's about inclusivity, what a fully accessible Boston looks like, and I want to give everyone ample time for that. So I will end this Zoom and email you a second link, and then we can start from that, if that's okay with everyone. If any... Okay, great. I'll see you in two minutes. Let's see. Actually, I could probably email you. Okay, good. Good, good, good.",

And when I was building my space, it really took me a lot of work thinking, a dust-free environment, a fragrance-free environment. I'll wear an N95, I'll have them provided for you as well if you like. And also just with yoga, making it, my classes are usually an hour. If you want to book a private, you're low energy, you only have 15 minutes of time where you can cognitively be there, then 15 minutes, that's great. That's all you need.

      "words": "I can go next. I have a list of [inaudible]. I think Liz mentioned this already, but just regarding mobility, just sidewalks being wider so people who have mobility aids or even if it's a cane and you're trying... when there's these huge cracks or the sidewalk is uneven, that can be really challenging. And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\" I'm like, \"All right, I got a mask for you today,\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us. So I think there's just a lot of simple things, but like you said, most of all listening to people with disabilities, I feel. Sorry, I was trying to run through that. So when I saw the question, I made a list because I was scared to forget stuff.",

I would also say that a culture of care would be nice, and I don't know how to achieve that, but just a culture where people are more aware of disabilities including hidden invisible disabilities, and people are a little more caring of one another and a little more attentive when they're in public. If they see someone who looks like they could use assistance, but respectfully don't force yourself on them, and just things like that. I think Boston could be more accessible if there were more enthusiasm for disabled workers and students. This is such a college town in a lot of ways. There's just so many institutions here, but I consistently hear from friends and acquaintances at many different institutions that their disabilities are seen as a burden by the institution as something that they have to deal with as more bureaucratic red tape. And it should be met with enthusiasm because you're bringing a new and unique perspective to your institution, so you're actually bringing a gift. And that should also be the same for the workplace as well, I believe. There's probably other stuff I thought of that I forgot about, but that's all that comes to mind right now.",

Let me do a quick Google search,\" and stuff like that. But I think that, yeah, it often is looked at as a burden. I think I had a good experience with a medical professional more recently where she had never heard of my chronic illness before, and then the next day she was like, \"You've actually taught me a lot and now I feel better suited if someone else comes to the ER with this.\" And she acknowledged her lack of knowledge at the beginning and then also how that feedback can improve her work and help better care for individuals. But agreed about the employment, and then I think a lot of just talking about neurodivergence as well as I think that is a huge factor in work discrimination, but also just trying out different ways to get things done. I think that also just psychiatric incarceration and the threat of that is a big thing in Boston. And when we're talking about the mental health field that is super under... We need way more mental health workers. We need to figure out ways to support them so they're not getting burned out right away. But something that is often at the forefront of my mind as someone with autism, ADHD, and PTSD is just, \"What if I have a flashback when I'm in public and the cops come?\" And just navigating those systems as well, I think is not only traumatic to the disability community, but often really does end in violence.",

So I think sometimes if you're not presenting in the way it's expected or people will assume, \"Oh, you're faking,\" or \"You're attention seeking,\" or \"You're being dramatic.\" It's like, no, they actually feel like they can't breathe. Or also the fact that people can have a condition, but they haven't been diagnosed yet because of access. So I feel people who have PTSD, they had PTSD before they're officially diagnosed with it or other disabilities that some of us have, if you're later diagnosed, you had it the whole time, but you didn't get that until later. And sometimes if they don't see that on paper, they won't necessarily believe you. And like you said, I feel, well, believing women in healthcare, I feel t's just a big issue in general. But listening but also recognizing it's hard. Part of me wants to say removing the fear, but I feel the fear's not going to go away until the system changes. But I feel one reason regarding mental health people don't want to reach out for services is what can happen if you do and you're not listened to? Or like you said, being forcibly admitted. And I know when I was in grad school, I think there was a period where there was depression and having some thoughts, but I was terrified to reach out because I was afraid of what would happen. And luckily, I'm blessed. I have a really supportive family and community, so I was able to talk to people and get support. But there was a clinic right there on campus, but I was terrified of getting forced in. And because I've heard of stories like that, and I know people who things like that have happened to. And I think also not infantilizing disability, because I feel sometimes the fear is that if you disclose, you loose agency. And I know a girl who said, as soon as she told her doctor like, \"Oh, I have autism,\" the doctor immediately just started talking to the husband and completely ignoring her. And when she's like, \"Hey, talk to me,\" it's like, \"What, do I have to sedate you?\" And I was like, \"That's really, really scary.\" So I feel just recognizing that people with disabilities or disabled people, we're still people and we're still adults and not children, even though I feel there's so much infantilizing of so many different autistic traits, and granted, we are a very acute community, but we're also still adults and human.

It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things. The alternate system to policing for mental health. Like, Sonya Massey comes to mind immediately among Elijah McClain, among other people, like just... So yeah, so I envision for me that Boston requires people like us to be in the room.",

      "words": "Okay, so the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding in a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. This approach helps to build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the others that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will be become part of the conservation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allow users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. And then this last bit is the consent process. So I'm going to read the paragraph, and at the end I will need a verbal consent. \"As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection. With the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities.\" \"Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will protected and the information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in having a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree, please say, I agree.\"",

Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And it's not listed on here, but I would include, because we're on Zoom, I recognize that it can take a bit of energy to be on camera the whole time and people might have appointments or meetings that they need to save their bandwidth for, the recording, the audio is what I need, not the video. So if either of you feel that you need to save some bandwidth and go off camera later in the conversation, that's completely fine. I would only ask for both of you to stay on camera during our introductionary question and then we can go from there. Okay. After hearing all of that, do either of you have anything you would like to add to the guidelines? No. Okay. So this is just the intro. I would like folks to share their first name, what they're comfortable sharing with. If you want, you can also use your pronouns and then also what brought you to the city or what your family came to the city for. What has that been like? Was it recently? Was it generations ago? I can share first. My name is Caitlin. My pronouns are they and she and my mom grew up outside of Chicago. My dad was born and raised in Boston. They met in Illinois and married and then moved back to Boston. And I am third generation on my dad's side, mostly Irish. Who would like to go next?",

I don't have the same immediate access to information being visually impaired as someone who is sighted. And so that leaves me to have to get that information in a different manner. But to go on to Caitlin's question about my concerns are twofold. It seems that we keep going back over the same issues over and over and over again and we make some progress, but we seem to get stuck at that point and seem not to be able to go forward. In that the city is rich in culture, but we seem to still be segregated and we're not being able to meet and learn and really grow as a collective city. And the other concern I'm really having is the navigating the city given all the construction that's going on as well as the new areas for buses being in the middle of the street as opposed to curbside as well as the bicycle. So it's harder for me to navigate and travel as independently as I once did with the new changes. And I know progress means changes for the city. This is going to work better environmentally hopefully, but it's still these changes cause concern for me in terms of safety.",

There's so much research that needs to be made in order to just navigate Boston and on a day-to-day basis. So if you didn't have to look up, is this building accessible, the train system will that get me there or do I have to switch over to a bus? Because there was times where the green line, which this has really gotten a lot better over the years, that's why I can honestly say that I could see it improving because they are still trying to make the city more accessibly friendly for anybody with a disability. But I also understand where there's also still a safety issue in trying to get to some of these locations, as Rhonda was mentioning, to get to the buses and stuff like that. If you're in the street, this has... you don't want to play chicken with Boston traffic. So I think if they took a step back and said, okay, we've made this change. However, is it friendly for everyone. If they just took that extra step with the changes that they're making to just make sure that they're including all society, not just the able-bodied people. So that I guess is what I would hope it would look like that. You could get a letter in the mail saying you have to show up to a specific location somewhere for doctor's appointment and you could actually get in without there being a situation where you either can't get through the threshold or there are, oh yeah, well there's steps to get in the building, but for the most part it's flat. Then you kind of going, well, okay, I still can't get in. There was an awful lot of situations in which there weren't a whole lot of curb cuts in Boston, especially in reference to the bridges you get on the sidewalk and then you can't get off. That's a scary situation, and then to be in the street. The city's coming along, but it's coming along very slow and I feel as though that it would look better if they would just take that extra step and say, okay, is it conducive to everybody?",

But how is that again for safety when you are putting people who have disabilities, mobility disabilities, cognitive, emotional in buildings and when we have to account for emergencies. It could be anywhere from something, a minor emergency medical to something even greater that requires a response and people getting in and out. How are we managing and creating housing that will meet that need. I think something is accessible, yes, you can open the door to it or you can, you access it with technology, but is it functional? Can I do something once I'm in the door or once I get to the door. I can get there, but can I utilize the service?",

It should be, and as we said before, collective and cooperative, collaborative approach.

I need to live in public housing due to the fact that there's both my husband and I are in wheelchairs and trying to find accessible housing on the outside of the public setting is very difficult. I've been told personally that all I needed to do was look at an apartment, tell the landlord that they have to make X, Y, and Z changes and if they didn't, then you would file a discrimination case against them. Well, in my theory on that is that you're not going to get the apartment if you tell the landlord that you want them to do whatever needs to happen in order for you to live there. The landlord is just going to choose somebody else that's not going to be that complicated. So when you're told, \"Well, these things exist,\" well, they do exist, but they're not theoretically conducive to the needs of all. But discrimination cases can take forever. If you're looking for a place to live because you need a roof over your head, that is something that's not going to happen very quickly. So that is also a concern of mine is that they're being more accessible buildings. The buildings that are being built, there should be so many of those that should have to be handicapped accessible and to the point where if it's a condo, if it's condo building or something, so many of those condos should be accessible for those of us who want them, instead of having to find something and then make the changes afterwards.

It's totally fine, and we'll make sure to take that information out. For the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build on an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. So, to achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. And this approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. So, secondly, I just want to let you know what's going to happen with these conversations. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. And we've got one more person. Great, welcome. And these conversations are going to become a collection. And there'll be certain keywords that folks can search. So, if we're having one conversation here, and there are certain themes that come up in another conversation, it will be easier to search that and see certain patterns of what people's experiences are like throughout Boston. This conversation will be part of an effort from a conversation platform that's developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, and the Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation. So, there'll be a transcript. It's a really cool new device that they're putting together. So, as a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance to the mission of Real Talk Boston and transferring Boston into a listening city. And... let's see. Mostly what I said, I'm just going to sort of paraphrase this. The sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this conversation deleted. And there are chances that the conversations will elicit strong emotions, and we just want to make sure that you feel safe and supported throughout this entire process. So if you all agree, if you could please say... Oh, we have one more person. So, if you could all agree to having this conversation recorded, but that of course you can also opt out after the conversation and let us know. If you could please say, \"I agree\", we can proceed. Anyone? You guys there? If you could just let me know that you're there or even turn on your video so we could have the conversation, that would be great. But if you could please say, \"I agree\".",

So speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. So, we want to hear about what you've actually experienced yourself. Allow others to speak for themselves. And share time. Allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Also, stay curious. Ask honest questions, and pause, and take time for reflection. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. So, is everybody on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you'd like to add or change? All right, let's get started. So, just to kick it off, we were supposed to hear from all of you, just your name or whatever pseudonym you want to use, and your experience about your journey to Boston. What brought you or your family here and was this recently or long ago? And what has your experience been like? I know this is awkward, but I really appreciate you all participating in this. So if anyone just would like to just kick it off by introducing their first name, I'd really appreciate it. To the group and just tell us a little bit about your journey to Boston.

So, now this is an example of when you didn't feel, oh, and I'm hearing from I got help by people in the community when you were still getting used to the community. That's another great example.

And can you paint a picture of what that would feel like to have a city of Boston that is inclusive? It does feel supported, supportive. We're talking about community.

There should be more location mobilized for public transport and there should be maintenance or more maintainers in the train, the driveway, and all of that. And I've said should also be developed in the sense of having some things that can be more of kids, like clean, like parks, area creative centers and all of that, and I think there should be reduction in cost of living, like our rent, pills, and all of that. So, and I would say there should be less requirements, less document are requirement for assessing healthcare in the sense of getting insurance and other healthcare or getting things that are healthcare services like assessing healthcare services at the assessing doctor appointment. So, I think these things should be bring down to the grassroot level so that everyone will be able to access them very easily. Of course, for me, I drive about 50 to 60 miles before I can get a doctor appointment, which is not supposed to be to my liking. So, there should be improvements in these things. Thank you.",

      "words": "Okay. First is the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversations with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with all the other conversations that are taking place through the city, will be shared with members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, CCC's deployment arm. The for assist system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as say with any conversation, there is a chance that you'll hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you agree and understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

      "words": "First is the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation. One centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with all the other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the non-profit organization, Cortico CCC's deployment arm. The FORA system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets, and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with a goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected, and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you'll hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"",

And also if the governments can actually support people, maybe those that do not have job, then they can just create job for them, in a way they can just make things more easier. And also for the aged care now they can just create support groups in a way that people will be able to attend to their health virtually. It's not like going to the hospital always in person.

So he said he wanted a bigger one and to get a bigger one, he needed a bigger income. And what he has now is not up to that. So he just spoke to me more about the house and he told me about getting up very early just to go to work and to meet up with the buses and the rest. And yeah, I actually had the issue with the bus as well. If I don't get to meet up on time, I get to miss my bus and it's actually a headache thing for me to just face. So I just had to just sit and wait for the next bus to arrive. So that's it. People, I've just been talking about the housing for me because everybody has their own opinion actually. So for me, I'll focus on what I'm hearing is basically the house and the transportation, I should say. Yeah, the house and the transportation.",

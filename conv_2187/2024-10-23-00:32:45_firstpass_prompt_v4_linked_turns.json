    "words": "It's started. Welcome to this conversation hosted by me, myself, Chauntia [Surname], and our technology partner, the Local Voices Network. Thanks for joining us. Here's our plan for the next 75 to 90 minutes. We'll be going over a few details about this project, establishing some conversations, guidelines, introducing ourselves, and then moving into a conversation. We share our vision and experience around community engagement in Durham. We're focusing this conversation and experience of residents of Braggtown area. I have begun recording at this time, and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. There are three reasons we are having this conversation today. We want to create change based on our experience. We want to make sure that our voices are elevated beyond the moment of conversation itself. And we want to better inform how the city invests money for equitable and green infrastructures. And what that means is that we are all tired of doing surveys, don't speak directly to us, to town meetings, answering surveys, and a lot don't get answered, so basically, that is what to create change base is about. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the city of Durham to use this recording in accordance with its mission. You also understand that this conversation will be a part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations and communities, and in the media that improves our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations and keep them with permission. If you agree and understand to this, please say, \"I agree.\"",

The problem is that the city doesn't build affordable housing by itself. So they have to get developers that come in and want to build affordable housing to build affordable housing in the city. We don't have developers here. Now if we did, if had some people, let's say if all of us decided we had a couple of million dollars to throw around and we wanted to build affordable housing, the city will even give us credits or funds to help build affordable housing. But if nobody comes up, if everybody wants to only build market rate, we end up putting out requests and just the request just end up sitting out there and nothing happens. So to do that, we have to get people who actually want to build affordable housing first for us to be able to have more built in the city.",

But here's the thing, I've only been here for a year, but when I got here... wait, I know y'all lived there your whole life. But here's thing. Miss Vanessa came up and took everybody on a bus tour to show them how bad it was. I had to sit down and was having meetings with them for a whole year and a half and then all of a sudden it got done. They found the money, we made enough of a stink and it got taken care of. I don't know what people did before me. I can't say nothing about that. But I can say something has happened in the year that I've been here, where there's been some results. Even just the fact that Chauntia, you are here and you've done a program, this didn't exist. Community partners didn't exist three years ago. And that's something brand new, because we got some people who want to shake up some stuff and said they wanted to do something and had an idea on how to spend the money instead of just waiting to find out. So there is a change. The thing is... it's slow, but that doesn't mean that it's not possible. So I want us to really talk about it being possible, because who knows, I could mess around, bump into the city manager tomorrow and have a long conversation and really tug on some heart stringss and then all of a sudden we able to get whatever we want. I don't know. But I don't want us to approach the conversation and be like, it's never going to happen, because I have seen stuff happen. I've sat at those tables with Sean Egen from the transportation department and said, Hey, we need money to do this, because nothing happened and there's a bunch of complaints in that area. And we've done it specifically for Braggtown. Other areas have not gotten as much stuff in the past two, three years as Braggtown has. So I just want to encourage you all to say that it is possible.

Right. So this meeting specifically is after hours and I have to be flexible to meet people where they're at. The problem is with stuff that's happened in our city for long, especially amongst city workers, is that we were moving in a way where we just thought, oh well if people care they'll show up, and then it would be a meeting at one o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday and you ain't going to get nobody from the community coming out who work at nine to five, they got two jobs, got kids, got this or that.

The thing is though, now we need to really make sure that we're keeping track of it, right. So like I said before, we have a chunk of money. We have a chunk of money that's going to come down and you want to put in your 10 cent, your 2 cent on what you want to have happen with that money. That's what this is, this is an opportunity for you guys to say, Hey, I don't care what everybody else talking about, but can we get some new lights on this street, that street and this street and that be a priority. You guys are first at the table. Literally this is the second meating of this type that we've had so far for the first round of questions. So guess what? They're going to look at you all's stuff. You all information and what you guys want for your area is going to be top on the list before everybody else starts hearing about it. Before everybody else starts saying, well I want this and I want that. You guys are in the front of the line. So that's what this is, this is you saying, hey, you all got 5 million. Well look, some percentage of that needs to go towards lights and a bus stop here. And now the thing is that's not the only money that this information will be able to impact, because we've been building better relationships with Go Triangle with Durham County. So, that means that we may be able to get something, we may say, hey, this is a priority. It may not be out of the funds that we have for the equitable and green infrastructure project, but hey, this is a priority to this neighborhood. How can we address it? Let's figure out until we make some money shake. There's a Durham transit plan that has a whole bunch of money tied up in it there. There's pockets of money everywhere. But we need to at least know what we should be spending that money on. And that's what this is about. Saying, Hey, you all ain't did it before, but I want to make sure that you heard that we need this. This is our complaint, this is what we need, this is what we have to, that this is what we want. And then it's up to you all to trust me to turn around and go and pass it up the chain so that it gets to Wanda Page, so that it gets to all the people who make the decisions and be like, this is what they care about. They don't care about, I'm not going to say any unpopular projects, because I don't want to get torpedoed, but they don't care about X project. They really want Z to happen. So let's figure out how we can make Z to happen. That's what this is. So is it always going to be realistic? No. Is it all going to be immediate? No. But here's the thing, this is the first time that we're going to sit down, we're getting this information and we're collecting it to put it in one place. So whenever that somebody asks, Hey, what do people want? Instead of us having to sit here and send down another 50,000 surveys and it's on one person's hard drive that got forgotten when he changed jobs, it's going to be somewhere safe with the department. So they say whenever we have a question, we going to talk to the community engagement unit and hear what they heard. What do you all already have? Let's take a look at it. That's how we address it.

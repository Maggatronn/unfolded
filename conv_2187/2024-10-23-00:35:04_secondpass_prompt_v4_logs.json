And we want to better inform how the city invests money for equitable and green infrastructures. And what that means is that we are all tired of doing surveys, don't speak directly to us, to town meetings, answering surveys, and a lot don't get answered, so basically, that is what to create change base is about.

So stuff gets lost. The thing is though, now we need to really make sure that we're keeping track of it, right. So like I said before, we have a chunk of money. We have a chunk of money that's going to come down and you want to put in your 10 cent, your 2 cent on what you want to have happen with that money. That's what this is, this is an opportunity for you guys to say, Hey, I don't care what everybody else talking about, but can we get some new lights on this street, that street and this street and that be a priority. You guys are first at the table. Literally this is the second meating of this type that we've had so far for the first round of questions. So guess what? They're going to look at you all's stuff. You all information and what you guys want for your area is going to be top on the list before everybody else starts hearing about it. Before everybody else starts saying, well I want this and I want that. You guys are in the front of the line. So that's what this is, this is you saying, hey, you all got 5 million. Well look, some percentage of that needs to go towards lights and a bus stop here. And now the thing is that's not the only money that this information will be able to impact, because we've been building better relationships with Go Triangle with Durham County. So, that means that we may be able to get something, we may say, hey, this is a priority. It may not be out of the funds that we have for the equitable and green infrastructure project, but hey, this is a priority to this neighborhood. How can we address it? Let's figure out until we make some money shake. There's a Durham transit plan that has a whole bunch of money tied up in it there. There's pockets of money everywhere. But we need to at least know what we should be spending that money on. And that's what this is about. Saying, Hey, you all ain't did it before, but I want to make sure that you heard that we need this. This is our complaint, this is what we need, this is what we have to, that this is what we want. And then it's up to you all to trust me to turn around and go and pass it up the chain so that it gets to Wanda Page, so that it gets to all the people who make the decisions and be like, this is what they care about. They don't care about, I'm not going to say any unpopular projects, because I don't want to get torpedoed, but they don't care about X project. They really want Z to happen. So let's figure out how we can make Z to happen. That's what this is. So is it always going to be realistic? No. Is it all going to be immediate? No. But here's the thing, this is the first time that we're going to sit down, we're getting this information and we're collecting it to put it in one place. So whenever that somebody asks, Hey, what do people want? Instead of us having to sit here and send down another 50,000 surveys and it's on one person's hard drive that got forgotten when he changed jobs, it's going to be somewhere safe with the department. So they say whenever we have a question, we going to talk to the community engagement unit and hear what they heard. What do you all already have? Let's take a look at it. That's how we address it.

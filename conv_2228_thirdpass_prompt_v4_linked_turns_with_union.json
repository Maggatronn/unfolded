    "words": "Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I'll have you guys do introductions in just a minute or two after I read the introduction that we have. So welcome to this conversation on Cortico's Local Voices Network sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a way for Mainers to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth and people and in major Maine industries. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we uplift the voices and the needs of the whole state, every county in order to build a healthier public sphere. And education of course is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing your personal stories from your lived experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. Following the conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education Action Forum of Maine and you will receive an email following this conversation, giving you access to the recording as well as all of the other recordings that have been part of this project. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. So please introduce yourself only with your first name and your role. Of course, you can introduce yourself with your last name if you want to, but typically we're asking people to do first name. And we have a little agreement to be recorded that I'm going to read. And after I read it, if you all agree, if you could say I agree, that would be great. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED 2050. The mission of Maine ED 2050 is to bring communities, educators, and youth together to discuss how education and schooling can be designed together for personal, civic and economic thriving in the next few decades. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve or understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

And a concept that came up in our trainings is adults, staff, teachers are so scared to say the wrong thing, they're not saying anything at all. And that's not a blame by any means. I just thought that was really impactful to hear, because mental health, there is such a stigma around it still that it can be really scary to approach these conversations. If you notice warning signs in a young person and you want to help them and not knowing exactly what to say. And so I think for me personally, what I've learned, what I've grown with is you can literally say, \"Hey, I'm a support. I noticed some changes and I wanted to check in with you.\" I personally overcomplicate things and I'm not saying it's a simple topic by any means, but even though it's a scary conversation, being a support, being that trusted adult in someone's life is so much more important than saying the right thing. And so that was a really powerful thing for me to hear and to learn and kind of grow with. And working with young people directly. They want honest communication. I'm not saying treat them like adults because they're, they're young people, they're still learning, they're still growing, but being honest with them, \"Hey, even though I'm an adult, I don't have all of the answers, but I want to help you. I want to be there for you.\" So this was a big learning point for me and an adjustment in making sure that I am providing the best support for young people while letting them know that, hey, again, we're human at the end of the day and we're going to do the best that we can do.",

I can't think of how many times that we have met with schools with a plan going in for a couple hour session with them on something and those plans getting completely derailed because we need to talk about self care with the adults because they might be approaching burnout at such a high rate that if we don't slow down and have that conversation, they're not going to hear and absorb any of the other content and information that we're going to be sharing with them. We can provide all of the awesome knowledge, resource, skills, abilities to folks, but if they're not in a space to hear it, to be able to internalize and reflect on that themselves, then it's gone in one ear out the other. And so being able to adjust and go with the flow a whole lot more than I feel like in the past has been needed. In terms of growing, something that I encountered when learning more about pronoun usage in conversation and introductions ongoing, is this concept of messing up gracefully. And that has just really resonated with me in all of the ways. So definitely comes out of the conversations and learning around pronouns, but it's something that I feel is important that we take and apply to all areas of our lives. There's such this focus on, as adults, we've got to do things right the first time. We've got to be perfect, knock it out, not have any struggles or problems or difficulties to overcome or overcome something. And instead by having that willingness to try something, try something we might fail at, commit and move forward until we learn that, hey, that wasn't the right way. That wasn't the right thing. But being able to be humble and secure enough in ourselves to be able to acknowledge that, hey, I said the wrong thing there. I'd like to make it right by doing X, Y, Z, I'm sorry, moving on. Taking ownership when we misspeak, when we misstep, when we don't act, when we should have acted. Again, acknowledging the human component to each of us, but also taking that responsibility within ourselves to speak up and to shine a light on that, to really normalize that none of us are operating at a hundred percent, none of us are perfect walking around and that's okay.",

Sometimes the most awesome piece of success that we might see is having a session with young people on Zoom like we were doing over the pandemic and having a young person in a really rural community sending a direct message saying, \"Wow, I didn't know that there were resources for LGBTQ plus young people that could be accessed online. That's so cool.\" Or hearing after talking with a group of sixth graders that one of them after our conversation did go to their social worker and say, \"Hey, I'm worried about my peer.\" On one hand I have dreams about the big successes that we're going to see that the more information that we get out there, that the bigger results that we're going to see, which is cool, awesome. But really that success for me is when we hear about that individual, when we can touch that individual person in such a positive way, either connecting them with a new resource, keeping them from feeling isolated, empowering them to speak up and use their voice that they have, that's so powerful.

To be totally honest, I have not yet had the opportunity to meaningfully dig into that. We have another survey for that coming up in spring of 2023. And between those two pieces, I think that's going to be very telling for us on where our young people are at. With the pandemic and the light that has been on mental health, I feel like there was a really big opportunity for positive change to happen. And as people have re-acclimated in, whether we call this the ongoing pandemic, post pandemic or whatever language it is that each person is using these days, I feel like as we've started to return to the sense of \"normal\", we're starting to see a pullback from understanding of youth mental health already, unfortunately. I think that the drive is there for more people to have that knowledge, awareness, and desire to do better. But I'm starting to see systems pulling back and trying to refocus on two things that were more traditionally a focus like with schools being pulled back to focusing solely on their standards. Whereas previously, maybe the administration would have supported more education around mental health for their staff. And unfortunately as a state, as a whole New England area as probably a whole country, we don't have a mental health system that is super functional yet. And I think that, that's something that is on a positive track or I'm hopeful that it is. But with the way that our system is set up right now, it is very reactive and we don't have enough providers. And the ones that we do have are working their hardest in doing their absolute best. And I am so grateful to them. But we look around the state and we see wait lists that are out of control. I hear about folks that have been on waiting lists for over a year for some services. And it's not that anyone's doing anything wrong, there's just not enough. And I think that how we move forward from this space right now is going to be very telling for what things are going to look like over the next couple decades. We're in a position to have legislature reevaluate where reimbursement rates are for Medicaid across the state. For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation. Not this thing that gets swept back under the rug because we've returned to what we believe to be normalcy. So I'm always optimistic that we're headed in a better direction, but also realistic in that our system is not perfect. The individuals that are in it are trying and working their best, and I appreciate that to no end, but we always have room for growth and improvement.",

It could cause them to feel like they're being rejected even though that's not really what's happening. So those things can butt heads in ways that are not what we want to be seeing, but hopefully there will be things in place in the future that might mitigate some of those issues with resources that we have in our system at the moment. And then to add on to another thing that I see, other factors playing roles in youth mental health is the conversations that youth are seeing on the political national level. It has a very big impact, and particularly in this moment, thinking about like the LGBTQ community. Consistently, studies have shown over the years that they are disproportionately affected at higher rates where they're experiencing depression and they're having suicidal thoughts more often. I believe that the rates in the MHSS data that came out recently is that for LGBTQ individuals, it's around 40%. That shifts depending on which group we're looking at. But 40% I think is the lowest number of those groups. And so when we're then seeing conversations on a national level where there's pushback against having conversations in schools, then that's affecting those youth because it's affecting their safety at school, which should be a safe place for them. So that's just one example I think of many that we could pull out, but that is one factor that immediately came to mind for me.",

And so I think that when we have administrations in school and when we have teachers and professionals and other staff that are at schools that are wanting to not just get through but feel interested in learning more, when they feel supported in learning more. So when the messaging is coming down from them or from their powers that be, that it is a strength to learn more, to be an updated kind of support for the young people, not just the messaging of get through the day, we'll make it to tomorrow.

And we've found that schools are really excited about this program and want to be super invested. However, the lack of subs, the lack of time to be able to be away from the classroom, to be trained in this program and feeling like one more thing added to their plate has really made them hesitant to bring the program to schools. And so as Kristel said, I think more was a great way to sum that up.

Terrible that it came about the way that it did. But I'm glad that we now have been able to see trainings that we would've previously held in one community doing a gatekeeper training in northern Maine. We would have one population that would be at that training, whereas now if we hold something virtually, we can get such a more robust group together. We can have people that are working in schools in southern Maine, northern Maine, eastern Maine, western Maine, and there is so much similarity, but also such different perspectives that come together that way that really allow for some creative thought into how we're navigating all of the things in schools these days. And it's really great to see that different learning styles are being acknowledged in adults, finally. So to be able to see that shorter learning blocks are super effective, so by people having noticed that in adults, that's filtering down to acknowledging that our young people definitely have different learning styles and that it's not a bad thing, that we find what works for an individual and help them be successful with that.

The financial literacy course in my school, the culture around it was the course for people who didn't know how to do math, which is completely wild to me because it was how do you write a check? How do you do your taxes? It was such important things. And then so kids are turning 18 and they're expected to take care of themselves in the world, which is an incredibly stressful experience because they're not being taught those basic foundational skills.

To be able to start with teaching our kids how they need to take care of themselves without focusing on where are they going professionally, where are they going academically first.

    "words": "Absolutely. As a quick add-on to that, I think of recently, Libby and I met with a group of students that were expressing some frustrations with the culture at their school that there was a culture of physical violence at this school and they were worried about how the school was responding or not responding. And they took it upon themself to put together these flyers, posters that they wanted to put up around the school to encourage communication. And it was done in such a respectful manner. It was very accessible in the way that they were designed. It was wonderful to see a young person take it upon themselves to do something like that, to essentially make an action plan and want to follow through on it. The difficulty that we saw in that moment was this young person came to the school so excited to be able to hopefully do something about this problem that they're seeing. And instead of being met with excitement or, Wow, great job with that. Let's see how to integrate that. It almost felt dismissive. And that's where a lot of our problems are stemming out of. We have adults that are working with young people that got into it for all of the right reasons, and their heart has been there through everything, but they have been stretched so thin, and they have had to give everything and have more asked of them on an ongoing basis that they don't always have enough left in them to be able to make that connection, to be able to be that resource and support. So we need to build out these systems in a meaningful way that makes it sustainable, that makes it so these people that care and want to help our young people can do that work. And that is a huge shift that we need to make.",

So I actually appreciated that they took a specific look at that. I think the other thing I was thinking about, that was kind of interesting, was this idea that children who don't have food or they have food insecurity, get fed at school, because that's just something I've been paying attention to. In California, we have free lunch, but it was a whole thing, because everyone was like, \"Oh. Why are we having free lunch for everybody?\" Then, also we heard about Tim Waltz when he got nominated, and his whole thing, it wasn't his whole thing, but one of the biggest things he did was free lunch for Minnesota school children. And so, that was really interesting to me, because I think it's such an odd issue to be contentious about, but it just goes to show that people can argue about anything, so those are kind of the two things I was thinking about.",

We have two ways, generally, of categorizing poverty. One is, as Martin said, just kind of like, \"Oh. It's somewhere out there, in Africa or wherever,\" whatever country is going through something right now, and so it's not really in our mind. The other one, the other way of thinking of poverty, is they deserve it, which is the two main narratives about poverty in the United States. People would be like, \"I don't think the kid deserves it for being poor,\" but usually when it comes to the idea of pre-lunch and stuff, it's like, \"Oh. The parents shouldn't be relying on things. That'll just keep them from taking responsibility,\" or something like that. I mean, that's generally how those conversations go. Personally, I haven't directly engaged too much.

    "words": "So I think it's a slow morning. It's taking me a little bit to process, but one of the things that I was kind of thinking about was, at least in my high school, I remember the switch to free lunch. I remember we used to pay for lunch, and they kind of had free or reduced lunch, and then everyone paid for lunch. I mean, didn't pay for lunch, like they passed a bill and it was free lunch. People were kind of like, \"Oh. That's weird,\" but then it ended up being a really good thing, not only for the people who were food insecure, but then you had people who probably could afford food, but they were actually eating lunch for once in their lives. They weren't forgetting to eat, they weren't not packing food, because they realized, \"Oh, it's there. Let me just go eat something,\" so it ended up being a net positive for everyone. I mean, other than just the baseline, \"Yes, we should feed our kids,\" it was one of the most beneficial arguments to why we should provide this baseline. I think the other thing I was thinking about was, during COVID, when everything was shut down, schools became, at least in California, the place for people to get their food. They were still providing free lunch. They had drop-offs, they had places for people to come in and get their food, and I know because I had some people I know volunteer at the school, helping with distribution and helping make sure, and a lot of people actually came and grabbed food because this is what they relied on, and so I think that was really important. I have never really had a conversation with someone who is anti providing, not just kids free lunch, but I guess things like that, but what I do think is kind of funny is when this topic, like very recently with Tim Waltz, came in the mainstream, one of my favorite teachers I follow on Instagram, and he posted this thing about, it was just this joke. It was someone he was making fun of. He was like, \"Who is going to pay for kids free lunch? Who's going to pay for kids free lunch?\" He was like, \"Me. I will pay for kids free lunch,\" because I think the issue is when people are arguing about, \"\"Why do my taxes have to be taken for your mistake? It was kind of reassuring to see that that's not the majoritarian narrative. There are a lot of people who are like, \"Actually, no. This is important. We should pay for our kids' free lunch.\" As someone who is still a teenager, it was kind of scary for a second for a lot of people to be like, \"Tim Waltz did something wrong.\" I was like, \"What? That's crazy,\" so yeah, I think that was important. The last thing is, I know we're talking a lot about school lunches and things like that, which is important, but the other thing is I think child hunger and child poverty is such an issue in urban areas because of food deserts. I know in LA, a lot of people's closest grocery store is a liquor store. Some of my friends, I remember we wanted snacks, and so we would have to go walk to a liquor store nearby to grab snacks, and I was like, \"That's crazy.\" I feel like that's also such an under, I don't want to say under-understood. I don't know what the word I'm looking for, I'm searching for right now, is part of the reason why we have so much food insecurity in the US.",

You did something to get up to where you are. But the flip side of that, the natural flip side, the unavoidable flip side is that, if you are poor, then you have failed to do something or you've done something wrong and such.

I feel like I think most of us would choose not to believe that, but the issue then is that if you try and take that, if you do decide to take that and run with it, you kind of end up running into a lot of other foundational kind of assumptions about America and its economic system and such, which is why people, I think, are generally unwilling to do that.",

With the amount of people like attending church decreasing, a resource for a lot of food insecure families also diminished. So not only did that change how some people were aiding that need, there's just so many different contributors that, like I said, changed after COVID.

It kind of reminds me of a lot of the news videos that you see there, because the subtitles are there, so you can watch it on mute and you can still watch it and things like that, which I think makes sense to me, right? Because if you're editing something for social media, it needs to be short, and it kind of needs to be emotional so people watch it, which I think, and I can expand on this later, isn't beneficial, but it's also not the worst thing, because I think if you're putting something on social media, the idea is not necessarily, \"Oh, let's spark a lot of conversations.\" It's kind of like, \"Let's bring awareness to this issue,\" and that's a whole other, I think, issue with social media, but I think that's also kind of what the format is there, right? It's like, \"This is an issue. Now you're aware of it,\" type beat, so that is what I was thinking concerning this. I don't think they were trying to challenge anyone's assumptions that child poverty is bad, but more like, \"Hey, this is a thing,\" because there are some people that don't know this is a thing. I'm thinking of teenagers who are not really, I don't want to say I'm relegating to slang right now, I'm like teenagers who aren't captain. You know what I mean?

Anyways, so I was thinking about, we talked a little bit about the cons, I guess, per se, about why some people are okay, in theory, about children going hungry, and it made me think about, maybe I think a lot of people mentioned that they didn't have the chance to talk to someone like that, which I think is, to be honest, I think a good thing, more than anything. But for me, personally, I feel like some of the arguments that I've heard, because I feel like I've had those conversations even with some members of my community, is that it feels like, sorry, I got distracted by [Ritika]'s, is that a dog? Where is the dog? Oh, so cute. Oh, I actually forgot what I was going to say. That dog was really cute. Anyway, I think some people, another I guess argument that some people would bring up in conversations is that people become dependent on handouts, like when they're offered free resources or reduced resources. I guess this all goes back to the American dream narrative, that I think Zahad had mentioned, which is that if you work hard, then you're going to have a good life. That's the whole premise of, we're in a country of opportunity, and so if you're here and you're willing to be able to work every single day, and you're not going to take no for an answer, at the end, you're going to win in life. For example, poverty wouldn't even be something that's on your path. That kind of made me think about people who supposedly have made it, and obviously, I think in their life they've had a lot of different opportunities and people who are willing to support them to get there as well, but what's interesting is that oftentimes when I talk to these people, kind of at their prime, at a time where they don't really have to worry about poverty as much anymore, they kind of start having this different mentality, which is that, \"I made it here because I never relied on free or reduced resources. I made it here because I went to bed hungry. I was willing to wake up early every single day, and I went to work, and I didn't complain about it,\" so that was just something that I thought about when we were having the conversation, but is there anyone else who wants to make a connection?",

The interviewer asked me like, \"Oh. What's a project you've been working on?\" So I was telling them about my work with legal aid and helping people get resources to get their citizenship, and he kind of looks at me, and he is like, \"Why?\" I was like, \"My parents needed their citizenship, and I have a lot of family that did, and it was really,\" Brianna's face, Brianna's face, and by the way, this was not a white man. This was someone who was very clearly second generation, and I was explaining to him why. He goes, \"Yeah, but my parents did it.\" Again, this is a college interview. I was like, \"This is not where we're supposed to be having this issue. I was just telling you about what I do in my free time.\" He was like, \"No,\" and he's a doctor, by the way, who graduated from Georgetown. Yeah, it was Georgetown. He was like, \"Well, my parents figured it out, and so I'm sure they did too. Your parents probably figured it out. They did it without programs like yours.\" I was like, \"Yeah, barely. They barely did it, and they were pretty well off, all things considered, so let's consider the people that aren't well off.\" And so, it was the most conversation I had had about this, because I think, Jessie, you kind of hit the nail on the head. It's like people start with this empathy, and then they kind of do it, and there's slowly this ideological shift, where they're like, \"Well, I did it by myself, so you should do it by yourself too.\" It's kind of like how people were so against student loan forgiveness, because they paid off their own student loans. I was like, \"That's crazy.\" It's kind of like a sinking ship mentality, like take everyone down with me. I don't know. I think it's one of the most frustrating things about current American politics, where there's this very individualistic view of what a person should be able to do for themselves, but the issue is A, that's harming everyone else around them, and B, it's harming people who had no say in the decision, like kids who couldn't afford lunch, and they're also not supposed to be working full-time jobs. Why are we punishing them? I mean, I would go so far as to say, why are we punishing their parents too? But even on a base level, why are we punishing them? It's crazy to me. It's obscene.

I like reading things that are longer form, that give me a fuller picture. For me at least, I don't follow news accounts on Instagram. Instagram for me is a place to catch up with my friends. I don't follow the New York Times, things like that; however, I know that other people do, so I actually do think there is some benefit to developing documentaries, or not documentaries because I don't think you can call something that's two minutes a documentary, but short form videos about social issues, because I know that is how a lot of people get their news. But for me, personally, I don't appreciate doing that. I think, I mean, it can be misinformation, not that I think this is, but I think that it's just a little bit harder to tell on social media platforms and things like that, what someone's motivation is, so just making it clear what the point is.

Are you using this to advertise the documentary?\" And so, I looked up what the actual documentary was, and it isn't entirely about food insecurity. It's about poverty and surrounding issues in the United States, in which case I don't think that this is a good representation of all of that, because I assume they would probably try and give a bit of every perspective. I can't imagine you have a 60-minute documentary about poverty and surrounding issues, and only talk to two kids, so it's not good at that. I think what you said about this being for Instagram, it's probably the most accurate thing, in which case, it's kind of strange, because on the one hand, if the purpose of the video is to direct people to the longer video and draw people in, like a trailer, that's obviously failed at doing that. Also, because you can't click the link. It doesn't go to the right link. But we already talked, I think, a lot about the potential education value of something like this, and there isn't much. I mean, I think the one good thing about it maybe is just in the sense of general humanization. That's fair. I can get behind that. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, anyway, and if it was on an Instagram reel, people would probably just scroll away, because, yeah, I also generally dislike sort of, \"Ooh, attention grabbing news,\" type things that have cropped up. This isn't that. This is kind of just a person talking for a long time, by short form content standards.

Even though we talked about, it does open more questions than it answers, it doesn't actually inspire us to seek out the answers to those questions.

Because I think instilling the right mindset in younger generations is going to break that stigma of whatever the opposite, like what we were saying before, we can't think of anybody that thinks child poverty is good. Even if there is out there that we just haven't, I guess, come across yet, this would be breaking that stigma. I think there's a lot of stigma around this, so that would be starting with the kids. So just kind of seeing what are these kids, the younger kids, thinking that aren't receiving this, and then, also talking to adults, again, that think on the opposite end that, \"My money shouldn't be going towards this,\" and just, while it's going to be uncomfortable to hear it for us, but it would be nice to hear it.

I don't think the conversation ever really gets quiet. I really think it's more like our minds are at work, and sometimes we just need a second to think or to wake up, because it's too early. So with that, I'm going to post a link for our post survey. Just to remind you, this is the child poverty post-survey. Yeah.",

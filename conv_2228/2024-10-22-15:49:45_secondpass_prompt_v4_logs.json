I'll have you guys do introductions in just a minute or two after I read the introduction that we have. So welcome to this conversation on Cortico's Local Voices Network sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a way for Mainers to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth and people and in major Maine industries. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we uplift the voices and the needs of the whole state, every county in order to build a healthier public sphere. And education of course is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing your personal stories from your lived experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. Following the conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education Action Forum of Maine and you will receive an email following this conversation, giving you access to the recording as well as all of the other recordings that have been part of this project. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. So please introduce yourself only with your first name and your role. Of course, you can introduce yourself with your last name if you want to, but typically we're asking people to do first name. And we have a little agreement to be recorded that I'm going to read. And after I read it, if you all agree, if you could say I agree, that would be great. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED 2050. The mission of Maine ED 2050 is to bring communities, educators, and youth together to discuss how education and schooling can be designed together for personal, civic and economic thriving in the next few decades. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve or understanding of one another.

Thinking about the growth learning and changing definitely around that flexibility and willingness to adapt to the needs in the moment. I can't think of how many times that we have met with schools with a plan going in for a couple hour session with them on something and those plans getting completely derailed because we need to talk about self care with the adults because they might be approaching burnout at such a high rate that if we don't slow down and have that conversation, they're not going to hear and absorb any of the other content and information that we're going to be sharing with them. We can provide all of the awesome knowledge, resource, skills, abilities to folks, but if they're not in a space to hear it, to be able to internalize and reflect on that themselves, then it's gone in one ear out the other. And so being able to adjust and go with the flow a whole lot more than I feel like in the past has been needed. In terms of growing, something that I encountered when learning more about pronoun usage in conversation and introductions ongoing, is this concept of messing up gracefully. And that has just really resonated with me in all of the ways. So definitely comes out of the conversations and learning around pronouns, but it's something that I feel is important that we take and apply to all areas of our lives.

But being able to be humble and secure enough in ourselves to be able to acknowledge that, hey, I said the wrong thing there. I'd like to make it right by doing X, Y, Z, I'm sorry, moving on. Taking ownership when we misspeak, when we misstep, when we don't act, when we should have acted.

And between those two pieces, I think that's going to be very telling for us on where our young people are at. With the pandemic and the light that has been on mental health, I feel like there was a really big opportunity for positive change to happen. And as people have re-acclimated in, whether we call this the ongoing pandemic, post pandemic or whatever language it is that each person is using these days, I feel like as we've started to return to the sense of \\\"normal\\\", we're starting to see a pullback from understanding of youth mental health already, unfortunately. I think that the drive is there for more people to have that knowledge, awareness, and desire to do better. But I'm starting to see systems pulling back and trying to refocus on two things that were more traditionally a focus like with schools being pulled back to focusing solely on their standards. Whereas previously, maybe the administration would have supported more education around mental health for their staff. And unfortunately as a state, as a whole New England area as probably a whole country, we don't have a mental health system that is super functional yet. And I think that, that's something that is on a positive track or I'm hopeful that it is. But with the way that our system is set up right now, it is very reactive and we don't have enough providers. And the ones that we do have are working their hardest in doing their absolute best. And I am so grateful to them. But we look around the state and we see wait lists that are out of control.

For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation.

It has a very big impact, and particularly in this moment, thinking about like the LGBTQ community. Consistently, studies have shown over the years that they are disproportionately affected at higher rates where they're experiencing depression and they're having suicidal thoughts more often.

But 40% I think is the lowest number of those groups. And so when we're then seeing conversations on a national level where there's pushback against having conversations in schools, then that's affecting those youth because it's affecting their safety at school, which should be a safe place for them.

For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation. Not this thing that gets swept back under the rug because we've returned to what we believe to be normalcy. So I'm always optimistic that we're headed in a better direction, but also realistic in that our system is not perfect. The individuals that are in it are trying and working their best, and I appreciate that to no end, but we always have room for growth and improvement.\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 49,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Fiona\",\n  \"words\": \"Kind of related to what you guys were saying about waiting lists and providers and there not being enough providers or insurance, I mean, I know there are a lot of complicating factors relating to the wait lists, but do you feel like pursuing a career in mental health and specifically youth mental health is valued in Maine and in your communities?\"\n}\n\n**Output instructions:**\nStep 1: Consider the above, in which Fiona responds to Kristel.\nStep 2: Identify the part of Speaker Turn 2 that specifically responds to something in the previous turn.

And instead of being met with excitement or, Wow, great job with that. Let's see how to integrate that. It almost felt dismissive. And that's where a lot of our problems are stemming out of. We have adults that are working with young people that got into it for all of the right reasons, and their heart has been there through everything, but they have been stretched so thin, and they have had to give everything and have more asked of them on an ongoing basis that they don't always have enough left in them to be able to make that connection, to be able to be that resource and support.

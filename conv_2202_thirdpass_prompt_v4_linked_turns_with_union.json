We have some notepads, stress balls, water, candy, any masks, you can reach out to me, I'll put my phone number and my email in the chat now, but please reach out to me after this and then I can give you directions to our office, so that you can pick those things up. All right everyone, so thank you so much for joining this community conversation with the Public Health Course Storytelling Project. I'll start by just sharing some information about our purpose today and your role in this conversation and in this project. So we're almost two and a half years into the pandemic and the struggle around accurate, reliable and trusted information is still real. The initiative that you're joining today aims to change that, this conversation is part of an ongoing community powered initiative called the Public Health Core, and that's a citywide effort with the mission to expand the public health workforce by partnering with community groups and community health workers to eliminate the COVID-19 inequities through outreach and education and so the stories and the experiences that you share will be part of a citywide story library that amplifies the experience of you and other community members that are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We are recording the audio of today's conversations and the video portion will be immediately discarded, we'll get rid of the video and just keep the audio. To protect your confidentiality, we ask that you use a pseudonym, so you don't have to go by the name that is on your Zoom account right now, if you'd like to use a pseudonym, you can go ahead and change your zoom name now and I'll just walk you through how to do that. So to change your Zoom name, you hover over your zoom screen and click the three dots in the right hand corner, the top right hand corner and when you click on rename, you can enter your desired name and then click \"Okay\". We do encourage you to share your stories and experiences openly and to respond to all of the questions, but keep in mind that you may choose not to answer a question at any time. Before I begin, I'm going to read a consent statement and ask you all to give us permission to use your voice and to use your story as a part of this project. I'm going to put an order of the participants right now in the chat, so that we are all able to verbally give our consent after I've read this statement. Okay. So as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the New York City Public Health Core to use the recording in accordance with this mission, you also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another, Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say \"I agree\" and I'll put the order of our participants right now, so that you can each unmute to say I agree. Can we have our first participant respond? If you understand and agree to this, please say \"I agree\".",

So let's go around, just quickly, and introduce ourselves, we can share our first name, where we're joining from, and just let us know how you're feeling, whether it's physically, intellectually, emotionally or spiritually. And so I'll start, my name is [inaudible], I'm joining us from the 10455 area of the Bronx and I will be checking in, emotionally, right now, I'm feeling very calm, so we can all go around.

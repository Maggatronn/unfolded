                "words": "All right. Welcome to the conversation at Cortico's Local Voices Network and United Way of Dane County. Thank you for agreeing to participate. I'm starting to record and to make sure we're all on the same page. I want to share the four main purposes for this conversation. First and foremost, we want to create a new space and a new way for members of our community to listen, to and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to offer ways for members of our community to connect with and build relationships with one another. Third, we want to support LVNs new and unique technology that offers a different way to hear and lift up the voices and concerns of members of our community, like you, and share them with elected officials, local policy makers, and members of the media. And lastly, to support United Way's desire to learn directly from our community to inform their work, United Way requested this collaboration with LVN to ensure that your voices and perspectives are available to help inform their fun strategic agendas. Following your conversations today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will be transcribed and added to a collection of the United Way Centennial Conversations hosted on LVN website. The audio recording will be available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in project at Cortico and United Ways discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the public. As a participant in this conversation you are providing consent to Cortico the operator of the Local Voices Network and United Way Dane County to use the recording in accordance with the goal to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in the local newspaper or website or to be broadcast in the local radio station or appear elsewhere, other forms of media. So please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. And if you agree, or if you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

We have a few guidelines for our conversation. These are the same guidelines that were included in the materials we sent to confirm your participation in the meeting. One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions. Pause. Take time for reflection. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact and when possible close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you would like to add or change? All right. And the names I just did are kind of like a modified circle so we can take turns and we'll just go by that order if that's okay with all of you. To do this, I will help transition us from one person to the next. You can always pass our pass and ask for us to come back to you.

I don't know the exact like proportion, but I grew up going to, and having a lot of Jewish friends and getting to learn their culture both in like my Sunday school and also from their religious services, which I think has helped me view my religion in a different aspect, but also to be accepting of people of different religions. But it also has sheltered me a little bit. The people from my area, we always say we grew up in a bubble and then when we get to college, that bubble has popped and I'm still learning and continuing to learn from different people around me. So in some ways I was privileged, but I also got to see some diversity, just not as much as what other people might've grown up seeing.",

And if they didn't have a mean intention just to put some perspective, like they're trying to learn and we can help educate one another.",

Just to speak for yourself, and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Stay curious, pause, listen generously, and also stay present. I just want to make sure everyone's onboard with these guidelines, we just shared in the large group, and if there's anything you would like to add or change. Okay, perfect. Now we'll move on to some introductory questions, and to make this conversation a little bit easier, in the beginning, we'll use a modified circle. So we'll start with Jessie, Amy, and then go to Martinez. Please tell me if I got your names right. I'm ... Okay, perfect. We'll just use this modified circle to make things run more smoothly. I also want to mention, you can always pass, and we can come back to you, or if you just don't want to answer that question, you don't have to. Feel no obligation there. We're just going to do a quick round of introductions. So, we're just going to ask if you would share your first name, your gender pronouns if you're comfortable doing so, and also, in addition, just share a little bit of background info about who you are and a value that's important to you. I'll go first. My name's Anna. My pronouns are she, her, hers. A value that's important to me is honesty. I really value people being honest and wanting to share their ... Just what they think. I think it just makes it a lot easier and a lot better. This value relates to the community and why I'm here today, because where would I be if people weren't honest? I feel like you can only get so far, and if people aren't truthful, then you're just being held back in the past, and you're not really present, in the moment. With that, I 'll pass it to Jessie.",

I think that, that includes accepting mistakes that you've made in the past as growth, in addition to looking to the future and accepting the way that you are, as constantly transitioning."

I'm an instructional coach at an elementary school in Sun Prairie. Something ... Jessie, I also want to help see Madison find its potential. We are so far from it, we have a lot of work yet to do but, it's great to know that there's other people who know that there's a lot of promise in our children, and our families, and beyond. My pronouns are she, hers. I would say that a value that I really hold true is, I really appreciate persistence and perseverance. Things are hard and we need to go through that productive struggle. I think Jessie spoke to making mistakes, and I just taught a group of fourth graders this morning, that making mistakes literally creates new patterns in our brains. They grow our brains, and so, yep, we're going to screw up along the way, and that's okay, as long as we get back up and try again. I'm grateful to be here.

What it needs to be, to be enjoyable by different, inclusive communities. Some of the ... We're doing a big landscape approach to ... Just a new vision. What id could really be, if it was perfect. If it was utopian downtown Madison, what it would look like. Some of the things that have come up, from just within the in group, is places where young professionals of color, where they typically congregate. We need different types of food venues downtown. We need different areas where Black women and young Black men can get their hair cut, or get it done at a salon. We need those comfortable spaces that normally exist within metropolitan, of Black folks and young people of color, where you might see in Chicago or Atlanta, Dallas, things of that sort, but not just here. It's just not here in Madison. So some of those small things, some of those cultural things, because culture is a meaning and people together. If we have all these people and they don't have a common understanding, there can be no culture, so we're looking to create a culture and craft a new vision for what it means to be a part of this community, and be a young person of color. Do you have the things downtown that signify, and are sign posts, for you to be comfortable in that environment? If you see a country club, you might think of a certain profile of a person that's going to be comfortable in that space, versus seeing a youth center or a skating rink, and some Black restaurant food nearby. So we have to create those spaces for people to coexist, and build, and feel safe. It happens in other parts of the country, it's just not happening here, just yet. But we're on the precipice of change right now. So yeah, I'm excited. I'm definitely excited for folks like Jessie to be back in this environment, for innovative thinkers like Amy, who's been around for a while, to think about how we can make this even better."

And if the other person joins us in another moment or so, I will just leave space for them to do the introduction and repeat myself a bit. But welcome everyone, I'm so glad to have you here. My name is Adrienne, and this is a conversation for the city of Cambridge. We're working with a partner called Cortico and their local voice network, to record these conversations. And the video of this conversation will be discarded, but the recording will become part of a public collection, the audio, a public collection for the local voice network platform, and shared with the city council and the mayor's office directly. The Cambridge City Council has launched a community engagement phase of the search for the new city manager. And that city manager will start in the summer of 2022. If you're wondering what the city manager does, they are responsible for providing leadership and making financial decisions for all city departments and services. And our city manager recommends policies and programs to the city council, and implements the city council legislation. The office connects directly with Cambridge residents, hosting neighborhood meetings and responding to inquiries and requests. Always working closely with city council to improve quality of life in our community. As Cambridge moves forward in this important process, we need a media input from the Cambridge ... The broader public. Because that's going to have an impact on the lives of people in our city. And we want to be really intentional and thorough to make sure that we're collecting feedback, and we're collecting it in many different ways including surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This conversation isn't any of that, it's not a survey, it's not an interview, it's not a focus group. It's an invitation, an open invitation for you to share your personal experience, and provide us with a perspective on how the city manager process could affect the lives of Cambridge residents.

So a story that I have and an experience that I think Cambridge can more effectively challenge is, the issue of unhoused people in Cambridge and providing resources. Specifically every week, I volunteer at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and often at the First Church Shelter. Where I notice that a lot of the guests really do have goals on becoming a part of independent housing, and being able to use their experiences to really further develop what they want to do with life. And I think Cambridge really can take a greater stand on providing opportunities for unhoused people. And where it be housing, food, shelter, or even just having different kinds of options or services that can better aid with really truly deciding and knowing what to do going forward."

Welcome to this conversation sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine on Cortico's Local Voices Network. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from all around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we lift up the voices and needs of a whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier public sphere, and education is a part of that. So we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. The data is owned by the Education Action Forum of Maine, and you will receive an email following the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED-250. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand, and agree to this, please say \"I agree.\" So we have your [inaudible] consent to use it.",

I love that you can live here and not a lot of people will ask you questions. You can keep to yourself and engage when you want to and at both of those times, you're met with the same kind of feelings, you can reach out or you can stay put. And I really love that. So I really do love being in this area of Maine. I would love to stay on the coast. So hopefully, in 10 years I'll either be here happy or be somewhere else on the coast and be happy and probably planning to return at some point."

The thing is though, now we need to really make sure that we're keeping track of it, right. So like I said before, we have a chunk of money. We have a chunk of money that's going to come down and you want to put in your 10 cent, your 2 cent on what you want to have happen with that money. That's what this is, this is an opportunity for you guys to say, Hey, I don't care what everybody else talking about, but can we get some new lights on this street, that street and this street and that be a priority. You guys are first at the table. Literally this is the second meating of this type that we've had so far for the first round of questions. So guess what? They're going to look at you all's stuff. You all information and what you guys want for your area is going to be top on the list before everybody else starts hearing about it. Before everybody else starts saying, well I want this and I want that. You guys are in the front of the line. So that's what this is, this is you saying, hey, you all got 5 million. Well look, some percentage of that needs to go towards lights and a bus stop here. And now the thing is that's not the only money that this information will be able to impact, because we've been building better relationships with Go Triangle with Durham County. So, that means that we may be able to get something, we may say, hey, this is a priority. It may not be out of the funds that we have for the equitable and green infrastructure project, but hey, this is a priority to this neighborhood. How can we address it? Let's figure out until we make some money shake. There's a Durham transit plan that has a whole bunch of money tied up in it there. There's pockets of money everywhere. But we need to at least know what we should be spending that money on. And that's what this is about. Saying, Hey, you all ain't did it before, but I want to make sure that you heard that we need this. This is our complaint, this is what we need, this is what we have to, that this is what we want. And then it's up to you all to trust me to turn around and go and pass it up the chain so that it gets to Wanda Page, so that it gets to all the people who make the decisions and be like, this is what they care about. They don't care about, I'm not going to say any unpopular projects, because I don't want to get torpedoed, but they don't care about X project. They really want Z to happen. So let's figure out how we can make Z to happen. That's what this is. So is it always going to be realistic? No. Is it all going to be immediate? No. But here's the thing, this is the first time that we're going to sit down, we're getting this information and we're collecting it to put it in one place. So whenever that somebody asks, Hey, what do people want? Instead of us having to sit here and send down another 50,000 surveys and it's on one person's hard drive that got forgotten when he changed jobs, it's going to be somewhere safe with the department. So they say whenever we have a question, we going to talk to the community engagement unit and hear what they heard. What do you all already have? Let's take a look at it. That's how we address it.

The thing is though, now we need to really make sure that we're keeping track of it, right. So like I said before, we have a chunk of money. We have a chunk of money that's going to come down and you want to put in your 10 cent, your 2 cent on what you want to have happen with that money. That's what this is, this is an opportunity for you guys to say, Hey, I don't care what everybody else talking about, but can we get some new lights on this street, that street and this street and that be a priority. You guys are first at the table. Literally this is the second meating of this type that we've had so far for the first round of questions. So guess what? They're going to look at you all's stuff. You all information and what you guys want for your area is going to be top on the list before everybody else starts hearing about it. Before everybody else starts saying, well I want this and I want that. You guys are in the front of the line. So that's what this is, this is you saying, hey, you all got 5 million. Well look, some percentage of that needs to go towards lights and a bus stop here. And now the thing is that's not the only money that this information will be able to impact, because we've been building better relationships with Go Triangle with Durham County. So, that means that we may be able to get something, we may say, hey, this is a priority. It may not be out of the funds that we have for the equitable and green infrastructure project, but hey, this is a priority to this neighborhood. How can we address it? Let's figure out until we make some money shake. There's a Durham transit plan that has a whole bunch of money tied up in it there. There's pockets of money everywhere. But we need to at least know what we should be spending that money on. And that's what this is about. Saying, Hey, you all ain't did it before, but I want to make sure that you heard that we need this. This is our complaint, this is what we need, this is what we have to, that this is what we want. And then it's up to you all to trust me to turn around and go and pass it up the chain so that it gets to Wanda Page, so that it gets to all the people who make the decisions and be like, this is what they care about.

So right now actually I have to find two people that live off of a couple of streets in Braggtown, because they have the easement of rights for putting out a new ramp right in front of their house. So smooth concrete for ADA compliance. But we want to reach out to them to talk to them first, to at least let them know what's about to happen on their house. So we do reach out. I think the part that people get frustrated with is, we'll reach out and sometimes the same way that if everybody's working from nine to five and I work nine to five and I'm calling you during them hours, I may not catch you. Right. So this meeting specifically is after hours and I have to be flexible to meet people where they're at. The problem is with stuff that's happened in our city for long, especially amongst city workers, is that we were moving in a way where we just thought, oh well if people care they'll show up, and then it would be a meeting at one o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday and you ain't going to get nobody from the community coming out who work at nine to five, they got two jobs, got kids, got this or that. I'm not about to take off work to be here and talk to you and tell you, why ain't they cut down that tree that fell in my backyard a week ago.

We have some notepads, stress balls, water, candy, any masks, you can reach out to me, I'll put my phone number and my email in the chat now, but please reach out to me after this and then I can give you directions to our office, so that you can pick those things up. All right everyone, so thank you so much for joining this community conversation with the Public Health Course Storytelling Project. I'll start by just sharing some information about our purpose today and your role in this conversation and in this project. So we're almost two and a half years into the pandemic and the struggle around accurate, reliable and trusted information is still real. The initiative that you're joining today aims to change that, this conversation is part of an ongoing community powered initiative called the Public Health Core, and that's a citywide effort with the mission to expand the public health workforce by partnering with community groups and community health workers to eliminate the COVID-19 inequities through outreach and education and so the stories and the experiences that you share will be part of a citywide story library that amplifies the experience of you and other community members that are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We are recording the audio of today's conversations and the video portion will be immediately discarded, we'll get rid of the video and just keep the audio. To protect your confidentiality, we ask that you use a pseudonym, so you don't have to go by the name that is on your Zoom account right now, if you'd like to use a pseudonym, you can go ahead and change your zoom name now and I'll just walk you through how to do that. So to change your Zoom name, you hover over your zoom screen and click the three dots in the right hand corner, the top right hand corner and when you click on rename, you can enter your desired name and then click \"Okay\". We do encourage you to share your stories and experiences openly and to respond to all of the questions, but keep in mind that you may choose not to answer a question at any time. Before I begin, I'm going to read a consent statement and ask you all to give us permission to use your voice and to use your story as a part of this project. I'm going to put an order of the participants right now in the chat, so that we are all able to verbally give our consent after I've read this statement. Okay. So as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the New York City Public Health Core to use the recording in accordance with this mission, you also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another, Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say \"I agree\" and I'll put the order of our participants right now, so that you can each unmute to say I agree. Can we have our first participant respond? If you understand and agree to this, please say \"I agree\".",

                "words": "Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I'll have you guys do introductions in just a minute or two after I read the introduction that we have. So welcome to this conversation on Cortico's Local Voices Network sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a way for Mainers to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth and people and in major Maine industries. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we uplift the voices and the needs of the whole state, every county in order to build a healthier public sphere. And education of course is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing your personal stories from your lived experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. Following the conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education Action Forum of Maine and you will receive an email following this conversation, giving you access to the recording as well as all of the other recordings that have been part of this project. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. So please introduce yourself only with your first name and your role. Of course, you can introduce yourself with your last name if you want to, but typically we're asking people to do first name. And we have a little agreement to be recorded that I'm going to read. And after I read it, if you all agree, if you could say I agree, that would be great. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED 2050. The mission of Maine ED 2050 is to bring communities, educators, and youth together to discuss how education and schooling can be designed together for personal, civic and economic thriving in the next few decades. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve or understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

Whereas I feel like we've seen a time with a shift towards hope, health and strength, which has been something that's really important to our team in being able to have that shift in messaging because that's going to build that longer term resilience that's going to provide a whole lot more accessible messaging for our young people, honestly as well as adults because it's not othering the situation, it's instead inviting people in to have conversations around what's going well, how to grow, what's going well, and how it's okay for that to look different for every person."

We can provide all of the awesome knowledge, resource, skills, abilities to folks, but if they're not in a space to hear it, to be able to internalize and reflect on that themselves, then it's gone in one ear out the other.

People are recognizing that mental health is a significant issue, whereas when I was a youth, not too, too long ago that those conversations were not happening.

To be totally honest, I have not yet had the opportunity to meaningfully dig into that. We have another survey for that coming up in spring of 2023. And between those two pieces, I think that's going to be very telling for us on where our young people are at. With the pandemic and the light that has been on mental health, I feel like there was a really big opportunity for positive change to happen. And as people have re-acclimated in, whether we call this the ongoing pandemic, post pandemic or whatever language it is that each person is using these days, I feel like as we've started to return to the sense of \"normal\", we're starting to see a pullback from understanding of youth mental health already, unfortunately. I think that the drive is there for more people to have that knowledge, awareness, and desire to do better. But I'm starting to see systems pulling back and trying to refocus on two things that were more traditionally a focus like with schools being pulled back to focusing solely on their standards. Whereas previously, maybe the administration would have supported more education around mental health for their staff. And unfortunately as a state, as a whole New England area as probably a whole country, we don't have a mental health system that is super functional yet. And I think that, that's something that is on a positive track or I'm hopeful that it is. But with the way that our system is set up right now, it is very reactive and we don't have enough providers. And the ones that we do have are working their hardest in doing their absolute best. And I am so grateful to them. But we look around the state and we see wait lists that are out of control. I hear about folks that have been on waiting lists for over a year for some services. And it's not that anyone's doing anything wrong, there's just not enough. And I think that how we move forward from this space right now is going to be very telling for what things are going to look like over the next couple decades. We're in a position to have legislature reevaluate where reimbursement rates are for Medicaid across the state. For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation. Not this thing that gets swept back under the rug because we've returned to what we believe to be normalcy. So I'm always optimistic that we're headed in a better direction, but also realistic in that our system is not perfect. The individuals that are in it are trying and working their best, and I appreciate that to no end, but we always have room for growth and improvement.",

And between those two pieces, I think that's going to be very telling for us on where our young people are at. With the pandemic and the light that has been on mental health, I feel like there was a really big opportunity for positive change to happen.

I think that the drive is there for more people to have that knowledge, awareness, and desire to do better. But I'm starting to see systems pulling back and trying to refocus on two things that were more traditionally a focus like with schools being pulled back to focusing solely on their standards. Whereas previously, maybe the administration would have supported more education around mental health for their staff. And unfortunately as a state, as a whole New England area as probably a whole country, we don't have a mental health system that is super functional yet. And I think that, that's something that is on a positive track or I'm hopeful that it is. But with the way that our system is set up right now, it is very reactive and we don't have enough providers. And the ones that we do have are working their hardest in doing their absolute best. And I am so grateful to them. But we look around the state and we see wait lists that are out of control. I hear about folks that have been on waiting lists for over a year for some services. And it's not that anyone's doing anything wrong, there's just not enough. And I think that how we move forward from this space right now is going to be very telling for what things are going to look like over the next couple decades. We're in a position to have legislature reevaluate where reimbursement rates are for Medicaid across the state. For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation. Not this thing that gets swept back under the rug because we've returned to what we believe to be normalcy. So I'm always optimistic that we're headed in a better direction, but also realistic in that our system is not perfect.

And we've done a lot over the pandemic to build our technology usage, I think locally. But there's potential with the way technology has grown over the years, that there could be positive ways that it could be used to connect people. But I think a lot of the conversation around technology still is that focus on, Oh, but it could be this bad thing, or, Oh, it is this bad thing. Whereas I'd love to see some shift in conversation too, there are concerns with technology, but there are so many positive things.

It could cause them to feel like they're being rejected even though that's not really what's happening. So those things can butt heads in ways that are not what we want to be seeing, but hopefully there will be things in place in the future that might mitigate some of those issues with resources that we have in our system at the moment. And then to add on to another thing that I see, other factors playing roles in youth mental health is the conversations that youth are seeing on the political national level. It has a very big impact, and particularly in this moment, thinking about like the LGBTQ community. Consistently, studies have shown over the years that they are disproportionately affected at higher rates where they're experiencing depression and they're having suicidal thoughts more often. I believe that the rates in the MHSS data that came out recently is that for LGBTQ individuals, it's around 40%. That shifts depending on which group we're looking at. But 40% I think is the lowest number of those groups. And so when we're then seeing conversations on a national level where there's pushback against having conversations in schools, then that's affecting those youth because it's affecting their safety at school, which should be a safe place for them. So that's just one example I think of many that we could pull out, but that is one factor that immediately came to mind for me."

And so I think that when we have administrations in school and when we have teachers and professionals and other staff that are at schools that are wanting to not just get through but feel interested in learning more, when they feel supported in learning more. So when the messaging is coming down from them or from their powers that be, that it is a strength to learn more, to be an updated kind of support for the young people, not just the messaging of get through the day, we'll make it to tomorrow. That can make a huge difference in the partnerships."

So when I was in high school, there were no home economics courses. We were not, that traditional students learning how to cook, learning how to do basic things to take care of themselves as adults. The financial literacy course in my school, the culture around it was the course for people who didn't know how to do math, which is completely wild to me because it was how do you write a check? How do you do your taxes? It was such important things. And then so kids are turning 18 and they're expected to take care of themselves in the world, which is an incredibly stressful experience because they're not being taught those basic foundational skills. Which I think kind of echoes back to what Kristel said at the very start of this, that food, starting with something like food and then building up. To be able to start with teaching our kids how they need to take care of themselves without focusing on where are they going professionally, where are they going academically first. I think there's been a huge priority on academic achievement and professional achievement with that has thrown some of those basic self-care things to the side a bit. And I'd love to see those traditional things come back."

Thank you so much for participating in the Storytellers Project, sponsored by an organization called Cortico and the New York City Department of Health. My name is David [Surname] and I work with the Borough Park Jewish Community Council on their COVID Disparities grant. So why are we here? We're here because the pandemic is now actually almost, we're approaching it the three year anniversary in March. And, wow, that's really a long time, and yourselves, I'm sure have really struggled and countered and managed to get through the pandemic and we're probably very deeply affected by it. The sponsors of this activity, and I share this belief as well, is that really to understand something you have to talk to the people most directly affected. That means the citizens of our city who... Everyone has a story to tell, an important story that we can learn a lot from regarding just so many different parts of this whole COVID pandemic experience. So that's what we're going to do today. We're going to just have some questions and you're just going to freely talk about your experiences. Nothing to be nervous about, just talk about what happened to you. And that will be very, very meaningful for this project and for others to hear, to listen. Your responses are being recorded and they will go into a library with hundreds of others and people, I don't know what they're calling it, the voices of COVID or people speak about COVID, but I'm sure it'll be very interesting to stakeholders and getting a deeper understanding of really how people were affected by COVID. So I'm going to read a consent statement that's part of this procedure and so that everybody's on the same page and you signed your consent form. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the New York City Public Health Corp to use the recording in accordance with its mission. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. Okay. I just have to get that business out of the way. I'm wondering if I should sit closer. Just not taking any chances. [inaudible] Just a little closer. You all are really close. So our first activity is everyone just go around and introduce yourself and there's a little exercise called PIES, P I E S, where you just talk about something. It could be physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually what you're feeling today. So that's just what they call it, an icebreaker. That's the new, you always have to have an icebreaker. So when you start a meeting... And also say, I agree. I agree, when you're done introducing that you agree to participate and you heard the reading, the sentence I just read.",

And then you dump in all the holidays and then it becomes three times a week and the men go to pray three times a day. You're taking such a community, you're just telling them stay in your houses. The emotional backlash of being told to not go anywhere and not talk to anyone and not do anything, I think is coming out now more than before.

When I see pictures on the news of kids having parties, house parties, people on the beaches, Mayor Lightfoot saying, \"Look, what is the problem here? Adhere to these rules or else more people are going to die.\" I tell my kids and my family, that's why I wake up and go into public education everyday, because we have not taught people how to really be educated and how to listen to the news everyday, and how to find out what's going on in the world around you. Since people can curate what they listen to and what they view, I know grown people that don't look at the news everyday. They don't know what's going on. They don't know that 783 people died yesterday, or we got 1000 new more cases. So if you're living in this bubble, which a lot of our young people are, at least the ones I experience, because school is not working for them, or life isn't working for them, so they create their own bubble. They're just like pigs to slaughter. They don't really get that they are endangering themselves or endangering their families, so it's really sad to see that we've got generations of undereducated people, basically. I could go on for decades on that, but let's move on. The next thing I would like you to do is invite you to share a bit about your background, and take a moment to think of a time in your life where you felt participation in something really made a difference. How did that moment or experience influence who you are today? We're going to do a little quiet time here and let you think about.

But it happened, really, because I had a child that went into the public school system with an IEP, and I noticed the inequities that were happening.

I had no idea what was on when I walked in the inside, and I saw how the teachers are having to go through different things and not having the support, 30 kids in a classroom, one teacher, no other support, and five of them have an IEP, or 10 of them have an IEP, and she's expected to monitor these children as well as teach the other 20.

They never bother to see what's really happening. They never bother to see is it that the teacher just really doesn't want to get back to me, or the fact that she is so overwhelmed she can't. That's happening in our schools, in our community, but if you go up north, there's all kinds of teachers' aides, and there's such an inequity. I see parents that are leaving CPS and going out to different suburban schools, because they just want to give their child a better opportunity. I'm going to be honest with you, I was one of them.

I still work in CPS now, as a community partner, but I was up at Evanston Township High School, where I was for about six years, and I was a district-wide administrator. I was their first literacy coordinator, so it was about how do you get reading achievement up on a high school level? I was brought in to solve that big huge problem, and it was tough. But the one thing I will say that I was able to do was get every teacher and every department to know that they had to give kids reading strategies in order to, what am I trying to say? Deal with the content. To access the content. Because if you can't read, it doesn't matter what it says in your science book, because you can't read. You might know how a cell works in your head, but if you can't read it, you can't take the test. If you can't take the test, you know the story. I was able to do that, so integrate reading strategies in every content area, and we detracked humanities, which is English, social studies, and then, eventually, freshman biology. If you know how tracking works, kids take a test, and they get placed in a certain class based on that score, and they're in that track that whole four years. You can't get out of it, no matter if you got straight As the whole time you were there. If you get placed in a lower level class, you can never take an honors class, you can never take an AP class, because you're in that track. What we did was we got rid of tracking for those subjects for freshmen, so that, when they were initially placed, if they were able to achieve, then they were able to move up by just merit alone, and they were able to access honors classes and AP classes, and I was very happy about that, because you don't get into the good universities unless you have honors or AP, period. I found that out with my own kids. When we were going to school, it was like, have a good admissions essay, have some decent grades, and get a decent ACT score, right? But now you can have pretty much a top ACT or SAT, you can have a great essay, but if you do not have honors or AP, they don't consider it a college prep curriculum, and you do not have access to those top tier schools. That's the new gatekeeper, it's the AP and honors. Tell your parents that. When they go to high school, make sure they have honors or AP, it doesn't matter. My kid went to St. Rita, and he took three years of science, three years of math, two years of Latin. You know what I mean, I'm like, okay. And he got turned down by DePaul, Loyola, and it was another one, exactly. I'm just like, \"Wait a second. What is happening?\" But one guy at DePaul finally told me, and I was frustrated, as a parent, my kid is crying every night because he can't get into a college, that that was a new gate.

Due to a need for my children, I came to start working in the school system as what they call a community organizer and working with parents, and helping parents to understand how important it was to be a part of their child's education. But it happened, really, because I had a child that went into the public school system with an IEP, and I noticed the inequities that were happening. There was nobody there to really support me, and they kept telling me all these different things, that they wanted to put my child on medication and everything. It wasn't working for me, I was like, there's got to be another way, other than to have a child constantly on medication and walking through life looking, in my opinion, looking like a zombie. I became very interested in advocating for parents who didn't know any better, and that's what I do now. I actually advocate with parents and help parents to go in and help teachers. But the real thing that helped me and my moment that made me know that I made a difference is when I started doing this work, I went on the other side of the door, because I can tell you what happens as a parent when I'm outside of the school. I had no idea what was on when I walked in the inside, and I saw how the teachers are having to go through different things and not having the support, 30 kids in a classroom, one teacher, no other support, and five of them have an IEP, or 10 of them have an IEP, and she's expected to monitor these children as well as teach the other 20. It's not happening. And if it is happening, it's not happening in an efficient manner. What I do is I help parents to go into the classroom to support the teacher, and one parent came to me, who had two children that had an IEP, and she thanked me, and she said, \"You don't know, I didn't understand, before I came here. You don't know what a difference it makes for me to actually understand how important it is for me to be in here with this teacher and to help this teacher and to help this teacher with, even the other children,\" because once my parents go into the classrooms, they tend to have a whole different aspect of what the school system is really about, and they fall in love with the kids, and the kids, again, enrich them. They come back and they say, \"Thank you for giving me this opportunity. You made a difference. Thank you for letting me understand what really goes on,\" because we have a lot of parents that will complain on the outside of the school door, but they never bother to get involved. They never bother to see what's really happening. They never bother to see is it that the teacher just really doesn't want to get back to me, or the fact that she is so overwhelmed she can't. That's happening in our schools, in our community, but if you go up north, there's all kinds of teachers' aides, and there's such an inequity. I see parents that are leaving CPS and going out to different suburban schools, because they just want to give their child a better opportunity. I'm going to be honest with you, I was one of them. My child started out in Orland."

We know this is a depressing issue before us as a nation, and we are already gearing up for two other events of huge consequence for us in 2020, before this hit, the election and the census. We're here today in light of COVID to reflect on what matters most as it will be reflected in the census and the election. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but I hope this will be a time for some back and forth among us as we share our stories. For the next part of the conversation, we'll move from the format of taking turns speaking to a more natural back and forth conversation. I think we're pretty much there.

All right, let's move on to COVID-19. We want to move on to the conversations about your hopes and concerns about COVID-19 in your community. We know this is a depressing issue before us as a nation, and we are already gearing up for two other events of huge consequence for us in 2020, before this hit, the election and the census. We're here today in light of COVID to reflect on what matters most as it will be reflected in the census and the election. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but I hope this will be a time for some back and forth among us as we share our stories. For the next part of the conversation, we'll move from the format of taking turns speaking to a more natural back and forth conversation. I think we're pretty much there. I'd invite you to respond to the points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So, first question: what strength has COVID-19 revealed or uncovered about your community or neighborhood? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better.

I'm going to wave at you, how you doing, but I can tell you half the people on my block, and I've been here 20 years, I don't know their names. That's sad, it really is.

It was like, \"I don't know if you need the services or not, but if you know someone that does, can you please share it?\" And I did share it, and there were people that actually went up and utilized it, and I actually even took people over there myself to the food bank for them to utilize that. I was like, oh my goodness, it's that take care of your neighbor that came up. I speak to the gentleman all the time, we wave or whatever, but he was like, \"Hey, look, I just want to share this with you, because I know you have kids.\" He didn't see me leaving out to go to work anymore. Are you being affected by not going to work? Luckily, I can work from home, but he didn't know that. He just thought, \"Okay, you might need some help.\" Stepped up to give me that help and to offer that help. Originally, my parents are from down south, and down south, that's what you did. You helped your neighbor. Everybody in the neighborhood ate. If you had something to eat, you made sure your neighbor had something to eat. That mentality has come back because of COVID-19. I'm seeing that come back. People are sharing resources. I have another neighbor who called me up and said, \"Shay, guess what. My sewing machine, I'm going to start making masks.

And the senior starts at 55, it doesn't start at 60 and up or 65, so you can go. I live right below Beverly, so I was around the Walmart that had COVID-19, I think it was 20 people and two people died. I haven't gone near there in eight weeks."

Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. We have begun recording at this time. I'm going to share a little bit of information with you before we begin our conversation. Number one, only the audio is going to be recorded. As beautiful as you all look, it will not be video of your faces, so just of your voice recording. There are three main purposes for this conversation. One, we want to create a new space for folks to listen and learn from each other. Welcome. Second, we want to connect, build relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique opportunity to hear from black women. We are inviting you to have a conversation. It's going to be personal stories from your lived experience. We have a couple ground rules that you already saw within your invitation. Those are speak for speak for yourselves, out of your own experience. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. If you like to talk a lot like I do, make sure the others are having some time as well. Feel free to stay curious, ask questions. Listen, pause, take time for reflection. Then if possible, I know you guys are super busy, you have your phones, I know we all have our phones, we're like connected to them, but if we can turn it over, flip it down, so that we're not focusing on that, that would be great. All right. Everybody on board? Thumbs up. Awesome. Quita can you hear us now or Shaquota can you hear us now? Awesome-"

More recently I had a problem with my wrist. It just was in a lot of pain. I thought it was sprained or broken because it was just that much pain and I went to my primary healthcare provider and she ordered X-rays and it wasn't broken or sprained, but it was still in so much pain. I went to a specialist and she was just like, \"Oh, it's nothing, it's not really that big of a deal. Just wrap it, wear a brace for a couple months and you'll be fine.\" I was just kind of like, \"Well, this is a lot of pain. This doesn't feel like it's going to be fine, but I'll wear the brace and I'll do what you said.\" I wear the brace for two months all the time. It did not help at all. I just was kind of afraid to go back to that specialist or just my provider because I don't know what's going on with my wrist, but they weren't offering any type of assistance until last month I finally switched doctors and he just said \"Yeah, we're not going to go back to her, we're going to get someone that can listen to you.\" We found out what the issue was and now it's completely better. I probably wouldn't have had to get shots and steroids in my wrist if they would have just tried to figure out what the problem was in the beginning and actually acknowledge the pain that I was in."

Then, the other piece both Shaquota and April hit on which is the division that's here in Madison and how we as a community should come together. I think it's also important to understand that it's structured that way because white people want it to be that way. Right, if you're giving one person a dollar, another person 50 cents, then you'll scrabble who's going to get the most money and funding. I think once we all realize that, and I think a lot of us talk about it. It's interesting because I feel like everybody in their circles are talking about it. But at the same time, you have your missions, you're trying to ... Everybody's mission is important and is meeting a need and so I think that's what hard, Is just because it's like your mission is meeting a need. Then, I guess people may feel like if they do come together once again, they're going to get less than, right. I think just speaking for myself, I've been in this community for 12 years. I think I mean the most I've been active in the community is within this last year, maybe two years. That's telling because when I first came, I did try and go, not try, but I went to some of the black networking events. You feel it. Right? 12 years ago when I came I felt like there were these cliques, and I didn't fit in and I did not fit in. Educated or not, I wasn't from here, I'd only been here a little bit of time. I hadn't put in the work. Over time people, yes, got to know me, but then personally my lie began to change and I had a family. I wasn't coming out. It was homework, take care of baby. Now she's older and I'm trying to get back out. A lot of it too is my role. It's allowed me a little bit more flexibility in the community that I work with, they're older. But at the same time it's like there's a missed opportunity personally. I could have made an effort, but at the same time individuals who are in position to make that outreach didn't. I think really making sure that those people that are in positions and not ... What I felt is how some of my alumni feel when they go to white events. They go to a chapter and they're being told, \"Oh, are you catering?\" Right? It's just a cycle of how we all do it. White people do it to us, we do it to our own people. Right, and so until we understand. Going back to ... It's a lot of things that others said, it's self-love, self-care, just networking, connecting, uplifting, it's just all important. It's like, where do you start? You don't finish. It's a continuation. I think that that's what people are ... It's like, \"Okay, we started it, now we're done.\" Then, we dropped the ball. It's a marathon."

Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. We have begun recording at this time. I'm going to share a little bit of information with you before we begin our conversation. Number one, only the audio is going to be recorded. As beautiful as you all look, it will not be video of your faces, so just of your voice recording. There are three main purposes for this conversation. One, we want to create a new space for folks to listen and learn from each other. Welcome. Second, we want to connect, build relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique opportunity to hear from black women. We are inviting you to have a conversation. It's going to be personal stories from your lived experience. We have a couple ground rules that you already saw within your invitation. Those are speak for speak for yourselves, out of your own experience. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. If you like to talk a lot like I do, make sure the others are having some time as well. Feel free to stay curious, ask questions. Listen, pause, take time for reflection. Then if possible, I know you guys are super busy, you have your phones, I know we all have our phones, we're like connected to them, but if we can turn it over, flip it down, so that we're not focusing on that, that would be great. All right. Everybody on board? Thumbs up. Awesome. Quita can you hear us now or Shaquota can you hear us now? Awesome-",

Then I went to my doctor, I think it was a week later. She was like, \"Oh, no, everything is fine.\" I ended up going to the E.R. one night just because the pain was so bad, it was in a weird place and so. They did the test where they test your HCG and it's supposed to double every 24 hours, whatever. It was double, and said \"Oh no, you're fine. I'm like \"No, I need an ultrasound.\" Something is not right. Finally, I got ultrasound a couple days later and they found that I was pregnant with twins and one of the eggs or whatever embryos was in my fallopian tube and it was on the verge of exploding, so I had to have an emergency DNC to get it out. The thing was it took two weeks. I switched doctors after that. It was crazy because my doctor's like, \"Oh no, you're fine, don't worry about it.\" I'm like, \"No, this is my third pregnancy. I know something is wrong,\" but they just don't believe you. I think especially with black women, there's this notion of, and there's studies that have proved this, that they think that we have a higher pain tolerance or we're out to get some sort of drug or something and so we're faking this. It's just very frustrating because I could have died and there have many women that have died as a result of something similar because the healthcare provider's not listening. I also think there's this misconception that in Wisconsin that the reason why the infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are high is because something about lack of healthcare. It's not about the lack of healthcare. We all have access to healthcare. It's just when we go to the healthcare providers, we're not listened to. Then that prevents people from going because if the doctor's not listening to you, you're not going to want to go back, and then that's why we don't get care. It's not because we don't have access to it. There's just this misconception I think that people just automatically assume why things are happening and don't realize the innate racism that's occurring out the healthcare system.",

It just was in a lot of pain. I thought it was sprained or broken because it was just that much pain and I went to my primary healthcare provider and she ordered X-rays and it wasn't broken or sprained, but it was still in so much pain. I went to a specialist and she was just like, \"Oh, it's nothing, it's not really that big of a deal. Just wrap it, wear a brace for a couple months and you'll be fine.\" I was just kind of like, \"Well, this is a lot of pain. This doesn't feel like it's going to be fine, but I'll wear the brace and I'll do what you said.\" I wear the brace for two months all the time. It did not help at all. I just was kind of afraid to go back to that specialist or just my provider because I don't know what's going on with my wrist, but they weren't offering any type of assistance until last month I finally switched doctors and he just said \"Yeah, we're not going to go back to her, we're going to get someone that can listen to you.\" We found out what the issue was and now it's completely better. I probably wouldn't have had to get shots and steroids in my wrist if they would have just tried to figure out what the problem was in the beginning and actually acknowledge the pain that I was in.",

For me, that's what I feel like can get in the way of me being a well black woman because I start having imposter syndrome and second guessing myself and the work that I'm doing and I do extra work. Someone would write a one page paper and I'm writing three page papers. I'm doing all this extra just to makr sure that I'm being respected. Then valued. Right. I think for me, it's a lot about respect. I feel like that's what's gets in the way a lot of times for me being a well black woman. What has put me in a position to now ask which it has been approved, but it's ... I did ask my employer to relocate me to Atlanta to tele-work since we've been doing it for seven months. They approved it, so I will be moving to Atlanta next summer. It's funny, I just got the official letter. We're reading through the book when it's my husband and, of course they put it in there, it'll be discontinued for any reason or no reason. At the end of the day yeah, it's a business, but it's getting me out of here.

It is that isolation that prevents you from actually not even being able to start to survive much less thrive. I think it's a combination of these things. We'll talk at some other point about how you get back to policy and systems changes, but we really do have to work on how the eco-system, black folks, POC folks and white folks are engaging with us all as individuals, because if we don't get that piece, it's going to be, you can have all the policies and practices and stuff written down on paper, but it's not going to help, right?

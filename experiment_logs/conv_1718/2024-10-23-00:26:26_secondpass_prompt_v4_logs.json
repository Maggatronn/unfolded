And if the other person joins us in another moment or so, I will just leave space for them to do the introduction and repeat myself a bit. But welcome everyone, I'm so glad to have you here. My name is Adrienne, and this is a conversation for the city of Cambridge. We're working with a partner called Cortico and their local voice network, to record these conversations. And the video of this conversation will be discarded, but the recording will become part of a public collection, the audio, a public collection for the local voice network platform, and shared with the city council and the mayor's office directly. The Cambridge City Council has launched a community engagement phase of the search for the new city manager. And that city manager will start in the summer of 2022. If you're wondering what the city manager does, they are responsible for providing leadership and making financial decisions for all city departments and services. And our city manager recommends policies and programs to the city council, and implements the city council legislation. The office connects directly with Cambridge residents, hosting neighborhood meetings and responding to inquiries and requests. Always working closely with city council to improve quality of life in our community. As Cambridge moves forward in this important process, we need a media input from the Cambridge ... The broader public. Because that's going to have an impact on the lives of people in our city. And we want to be really intentional and thorough to make sure that we're collecting feedback, and we're collecting it in many different ways including surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This conversation isn't any of that, it's not a survey, it's not an interview, it's not a focus group. It's an invitation, an open invitation for you to share your personal experience, and provide us with a perspective on how the city manager process could affect the lives of Cambridge residents. So we're asking for your honest input and perspective, we're thanking you for joining us. And before I begin like a flight attendant, I need you all to verbally consent to the fact that as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the city of Cambridge to use this recording in accordance with its mission. And you understand that the conversation will become part of the Local Voices Network collection, whose mission is to foster conversation and communities and in the media, to improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree with this, I would ask you verbally say, \\\"I agree.\\\"\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 8,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Adrienne\",\n  \"words\": \"Great.

So I have a few questions that we can start with, but I want this to be a time that you guys can reflect and build, have some back and forth between yourselves to share stories. And if there's a point that resonate for you, feel free to chime in. We do want to be mindful that everyone who wants to participate has a chance to do so. So I'll start with the first question, and then I have two more. And so the first question is, from your experience, what do you see as the positive role or roles that the city Cambridge government, or the city manager more specifically, plays in our community today? Please share a story from your experience that will help give us a picture about what you like and why. So this is a positive role, the Cambridge city government plays. And if you can be specific to the Cambridge city manager even better, but if you can't that's okay. We're going to start with that positive role, and know that the second question is negative role, or the concern you have. So there will be space for both.

Thank you Anise. I think that's something that's been reflected in a lot of the conversations that I've had so far. The city council hires the city manager to be the lead administrator for the city and in charge of all the city agencies. And so while the city manager is tasked with executing the city council legislation, there are ... They have the final say in a lot of matters, budgetary specifically among other things. Part of the reason that that was put into place was to avoid politics, essentially interfering in corruption. So this person isn't elected, which means that ideally they wouldn't be responding to corporate money in the same way that a politician could be. However, then you face the less democratic person that wasn't elected making the decisions in the city. And so there's a balancing act there. And Cambridge is unique in the way that this is executed, like a hired CEO that responds to the board. So that's I think really helpful to hear your perspective on that. All right. Well, if somebody wants to come back to this at a later point, we are welcome to do so. I will pose some other questions for you. One is, I would like us to imagine our ideal city manager together, and collectively share some of the key traits and skills that that person would have.

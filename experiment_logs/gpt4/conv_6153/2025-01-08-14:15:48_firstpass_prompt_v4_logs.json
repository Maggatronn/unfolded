Following our meeting, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the others that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will be become part of the conservation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allow users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. And then this last bit is the consent process. So I'm going to read the paragraph, and at the end I will need a verbal consent. \\\"As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city.

Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And it's not listed on here, but I would include, because we're on Zoom, I recognize that it can take a bit of energy to be on camera the whole time and people might have appointments or meetings that they need to save their bandwidth for, the recording, the audio is what I need, not the video. So if either of you feel that you need to save some bandwidth and go off camera later in the conversation, that's completely fine.

I need to live in public housing due to the fact that there's both my husband and I are in wheelchairs and trying to find accessible housing on the outside of the public setting is very difficult. I've been told personally that all I needed to do was look at an apartment, tell the landlord that they have to make X, Y, and Z changes and if they didn't, then you would file a discrimination case against them. Well, in my theory on that is that you're not going to get the apartment if you tell the landlord that you want them to do whatever needs to happen in order for you to live there. The landlord is just going to choose somebody else that's not going to be that complicated. So when you're told, \"Well, these things exist,\" well, they do exist, but they're not theoretically conducive to the needs of all. But discrimination cases can take forever. If you're looking for a place to live because you need a roof over your head, that is something that's not going to happen very quickly. So that is also a concern of mine is that they're being more accessible buildings. The buildings that are being built, there should be so many of those that should have to be handicapped accessible and to the point where if it's a condo, if it's condo building or something, so many of those condos should be accessible for those of us who want them, instead of having to find something and then make the changes afterwards.

The landlord is just going to choose somebody else that's not going to be that complicated.

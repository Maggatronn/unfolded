To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. This approach helps to build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the others that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will be become part of the conservation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allow users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. And then this last bit is the consent process. So I'm going to read the paragraph, and at the end I will need a verbal consent. \\\"As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection. With the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities.\\\" \\\"Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will protected and the information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions.

In that the city is rich in culture, but we seem to still be segregated and we're not being able to meet and learn and really grow as a collective city. And the other concern I'm really having is the navigating the city given all the construction that's going on as well as the new areas for buses being in the middle of the street as opposed to curbside as well as the bicycle. So it's harder for me to navigate and travel as independently as I once did with the new changes. And I know progress means changes for the city.

That we all have differences, we all have uniquenesses that need to be accounted for, but we still are people who are deserving of the same and we are striving for the same independence, productivity being contributors to our community and that we as individuals with disabilities should be part of the planning. Part of the development of the different system structures, that were not just a byproduct. You create something and we just accept it and we go forward. It should be, and as we said before, collective and cooperative, collaborative approach. My hope is that because the younger generations are now having experiences with individuals with disabilities at earlier and I should say younger ages, and they're interested in improving the community.

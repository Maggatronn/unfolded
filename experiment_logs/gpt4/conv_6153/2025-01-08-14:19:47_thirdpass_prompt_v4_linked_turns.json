    "words": "Okay, so the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding in a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. This approach helps to build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the others that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will be become part of the conservation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allow users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. And then this last bit is the consent process. So I'm going to read the paragraph, and at the end I will need a verbal consent. \"As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection. With the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities.\" \"Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will protected and the information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in having a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree, please say, I agree.\"",

Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And it's not listed on here, but I would include, because we're on Zoom, I recognize that it can take a bit of energy to be on camera the whole time and people might have appointments or meetings that they need to save their bandwidth for, the recording, the audio is what I need, not the video. So if either of you feel that you need to save some bandwidth and go off camera later in the conversation, that's completely fine. I would only ask for both of you to stay on camera during our introductionary question and then we can go from there. Okay. After hearing all of that, do either of you have anything you would like to add to the guidelines? No. Okay. So this is just the intro. I would like folks to share their first name, what they're comfortable sharing with. If you want, you can also use your pronouns and then also what brought you to the city or what your family came to the city for. What has that been like? Was it recently? Was it generations ago? I can share first. My name is Caitlin. My pronouns are they and she and my mom grew up outside of Chicago. My dad was born and raised in Boston. They met in Illinois and married and then moved back to Boston. And I am third generation on my dad's side, mostly Irish. Who would like to go next?",

But to go on to Caitlin's question about my concerns are twofold. It seems that we keep going back over the same issues over and over and over again and we make some progress, but we seem to get stuck at that point and seem not to be able to go forward. In that the city is rich in culture, but we seem to still be segregated and we're not being able to meet and learn and really grow as a collective city. And the other concern I'm really having is the navigating the city given all the construction that's going on as well as the new areas for buses being in the middle of the street as opposed to curbside as well as the bicycle. So it's harder for me to navigate and travel as independently as I once did with the new changes. And I know progress means changes for the city. This is going to work better environmentally hopefully, but it's still these changes cause concern for me in terms of safety.",

I don't have to partake in that. I still understand there's a bit of a competing access need there. I will share one quick thing. I'm a big transit nerd and I lived on the Orange Line when it shut down the first time for a month.

There's so much research that needs to be made in order to just navigate Boston and on a day-to-day basis. So if you didn't have to look up, is this building accessible, the train system will that get me there or do I have to switch over to a bus? Because there was times where the green line, which this has really gotten a lot better over the years, that's why I can honestly say that I could see it improving because they are still trying to make the city more accessibly friendly for anybody with a disability. But I also understand where there's also still a safety issue in trying to get to some of these locations, as Rhonda was mentioning, to get to the buses and stuff like that. If you're in the street, this has... you don't want to play chicken with Boston traffic. So I think if they took a step back and said, okay, we've made this change. However, is it friendly for everyone. If they just took that extra step with the changes that they're making to just make sure that they're including all society, not just the able-bodied people. So that I guess is what I would hope it would look like that. You could get a letter in the mail saying you have to show up to a specific location somewhere for doctor's appointment and you could actually get in without there being a situation where you either can't get through the threshold or there are, oh yeah, well there's steps to get in the building, but for the most part it's flat. Then you kind of going, well, okay, I still can't get in. There was an awful lot of situations in which there weren't a whole lot of curb cuts in Boston, especially in reference to the bridges you get on the sidewalk and then you can't get off. That's a scary situation, and then to be in the street. The city's coming along, but it's coming along very slow and I feel as though that it would look better if they would just take that extra step and say, okay, is it conducive to everybody?",

I need to live in public housing due to the fact that there's both my husband and I are in wheelchairs and trying to find accessible housing on the outside of the public setting is very difficult. I've been told personally that all I needed to do was look at an apartment, tell the landlord that they have to make X, Y, and Z changes and if they didn't, then you would file a discrimination case against them. Well, in my theory on that is that you're not going to get the apartment if you tell the landlord that you want them to do whatever needs to happen in order for you to live there. The landlord is just going to choose somebody else that's not going to be that complicated. So when you're told, \"Well, these things exist,\" well, they do exist, but they're not theoretically conducive to the needs of all. But discrimination cases can take forever. If you're looking for a place to live because you need a roof over your head, that is something that's not going to happen very quickly. So that is also a concern of mine is that they're being more accessible buildings. The buildings that are being built, there should be so many of those that should have to be handicapped accessible and to the point where if it's a condo, if it's condo building or something, so many of those condos should be accessible for those of us who want them, instead of having to find something and then make the changes afterwards.

For the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build on an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. So, to achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. And this approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. So, secondly, I just want to let you know what's going to happen with these conversations. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. And we've got one more person. Great, welcome. And these conversations are going to become a collection. And there'll be certain keywords that folks can search. So, if we're having one conversation here, and there are certain themes that come up in another conversation, it will be easier to search that and see certain patterns of what people's experiences are like throughout Boston. This conversation will be part of an effort from a conversation platform that's developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, and the Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation. So, there'll be a transcript. It's a really cool new device that they're putting together. So, as a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance to the mission of Real Talk Boston and transferring Boston into a listening city. And... let's see. Mostly what I said, I'm just going to sort of paraphrase this. The sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this conversation deleted. And there are chances that the conversations will elicit strong emotions, and we just want to make sure that you feel safe and supported throughout this entire process. So if you all agree, if you could please say... Oh, we have one more person. So, if you could all agree to having this conversation recorded, but that of course you can also opt out after the conversation and let us know. If you could please say, \\\"I agree\\\", we can proceed. Anyone? You guys there? If you could just let me know that you're there or even turn on your video so we could have the conversation, that would be great.

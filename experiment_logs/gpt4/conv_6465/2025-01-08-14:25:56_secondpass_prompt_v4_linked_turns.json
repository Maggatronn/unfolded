It's totally fine, and we'll make sure to take that information out. For the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build on an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. So, to achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. And this approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. So, secondly, I just want to let you know what's going to happen with these conversations. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. And we've got one more person. Great, welcome. And these conversations are going to become a collection. And there'll be certain keywords that folks can search. So, if we're having one conversation here, and there are certain themes that come up in another conversation, it will be easier to search that and see certain patterns of what people's experiences are like throughout Boston. This conversation will be part of an effort from a conversation platform that's developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, and the Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation. So, there'll be a transcript. It's a really cool new device that they're putting together. So, as a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance to the mission of Real Talk Boston and transferring Boston into a listening city. And... let's see. Mostly what I said, I'm just going to sort of paraphrase this. The sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this conversation deleted. And there are chances that the conversations will elicit strong emotions, and we just want to make sure that you feel safe and supported throughout this entire process. So if you all agree, if you could please say... Oh, we have one more person. So, if you could all agree to having this conversation recorded, but that of course you can also opt out after the conversation and let us know. If you could please say, \"I agree\", we can proceed. Anyone? You guys there? If you could just let me know that you're there or even turn on your video so we could have the conversation, that would be great. But if you could please say, \"I agree\".",

So, we want to make sure that everybody gets a chance to share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we introduce a few guidelines to our conversations. So speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. So, we want to hear about what you've actually experienced yourself. Allow others to speak for themselves. And share time. Allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Also, stay curious. Ask honest questions, and pause, and take time for reflection. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. So, is everybody on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you'd like to add or change? All right, let's get started. So, just to kick it off, we were supposed to hear from all of you, just your name or whatever pseudonym you want to use, and your experience about your journey to Boston. What brought you or your family here and was this recently or long ago? And what has your experience been like? I know this is awkward, but I really appreciate you all participating in this. So if anyone just would like to just kick it off by introducing their first name, I'd really appreciate it. To the group and just tell us a little bit about your journey to Boston. Pretty please, somebody? Who wants to get started? Amanda, you're first on my list. Do you want to tell us a little bit more about your family's journey to Boston?",

Anyone else? It's okay if you don't, but if you can think of an example, I'd love to hear it. Anyone can relate with neighbors, or university, feeling supported. Okay, well we'll move on. So now that we've talked about times where you did feel supported, I want to leave some room to hear about times where that didn't happen. Can you tell us more about your day to day, what you worry about living in Boston? And maybe this is related to health, finances, accessibility, inclusivity or something else entirely. So, what kind of support do you wish you had that you don't have that contributes to these worries? Oh Chris, I'm seeing from you, you saying that your neighbor was great and that she was there for me when I moved in and that she helped me out whenever I needed stuff. Thank you for sharing Christopher. So, now this is an example of when you didn't feel, oh, and I'm hearing from I got help by people in the community when you were still getting used to the community. That's another great example. Thank you. Okay, so are there any examples of what worries that you have day to day and where you wish you did have community and don't?",

And I feel like, I was saying healthcare and stuff should be more affordable and accessible. So, yeah, I think it should actually be a great Boston later in the future because of what is happening right now. Actually, it's not really like it's ill, but it's still good now. So, considering today, it'll be more better. So, I think seeing Boston at then to very good and I think it'll be very, very comfortable for people to stay and make a good life of it. Yeah."

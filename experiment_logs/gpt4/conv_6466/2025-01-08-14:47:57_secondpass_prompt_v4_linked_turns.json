    "words": "Okay. First is the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversations with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with all the other conversations that are taking place through the city, will be shared with members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, CCC's deployment arm. The for assist system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as say with any conversation, there is a chance that you'll hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you agree and understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

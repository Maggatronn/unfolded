I want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we will introduce a few guidelines for the conversation. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions. Pause as in, take time for reflection and listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have impact. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that comes out that you would like to add or tweak? Okay. One thing that's not on here, because it's a guide for every conversation, I will say, since we are on Zoom and being on camera can get very tiring at times, if you need to save your bandwidth for another meeting or you're just feeling you need some space, feel free to put your camera off. The recording part that we need is the audio, not the video. So if everyone is okay, I'm going to kick ourselves off with a round of quick introductions.

I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again?

I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that.

It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs.

I was in mental health, but then also I worked in the restaurant industry for 13 years and I was working there when I became incredibly sick. I have autonomic dysfunction and the restaurant industry is not accessible at all ever. I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs.

And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding.

I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns.

And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service.

    "prompt": "**Speaker Turn 1:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 47,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Gray\",\n  \"words\": \"Oh, I can share. I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 51,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n  \"words\": \"Wanted to chime in real quick and I won't talk about it much, but I just wanted to throw the big elephant in the room, housing.

I have a list of [inaudible]. I think Liz mentioned this already, but just regarding mobility, just sidewalks being wider so people who have mobility aids or even if it's a cane and you're trying... when there's these huge cracks or the sidewalk is uneven, that can be really challenging. And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \\\"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\\\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \\\"You must be able to stand for a long time.\\\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \\\"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\\\" I'm like, \\\"All right, I got a mask for you today,\\\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps.

And when I was building my space, it really took me a lot of work thinking, a dust-free environment, a fragrance-free environment. I'll wear an N95, I'll have them provided for you as well if you like. And also just with yoga, making it, my classes are usually an hour. If you want to book a private, you're low energy, you only have 15 minutes of time where you can cognitively be there, then 15 minutes, that's great. That's all you need.

    "prompt": "**Speaker Turn 1:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 69,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n  \"words\": \"I can go next. I have a list of [inaudible]. I think Liz mentioned this already, but just regarding mobility, just sidewalks being wider so people who have mobility aids or even if it's a cane and you're trying... when there's these huge cracks or the sidewalk is uneven, that can be really challenging. And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \\\"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\\\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \\\"You must be able to stand for a long time.\\\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \\\"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\\\" I'm like, \\\"All right, I got a mask for you today,\\\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us. So I think there's just a lot of simple things, but like you said, most of all listening to people with disabilities, I feel. Sorry, I was trying to run through that.

I think Boston could be more accessible if there were more enthusiasm for disabled workers and students. This is such a college town in a lot of ways. There's just so many institutions here, but I consistently hear from friends and acquaintances at many different institutions that their disabilities are seen as a burden by the institution as something that they have to deal with as more bureaucratic red tape.

I can only speak from my own personal experiences, but as a fat person trying to get a hypermobile EDS diagnosis, it has been very difficult because everyone is trained to see hypermobility on thin bodies, and they do not necessarily see the right angles on my body just because I'm larger. And it's tough because I've been told this is one of the best places in the world to receive healthcare, but I have had some of the worst doctors of my life here and truly in many different ways. And I think that in order for the treatment of disabled people to get better overall, we need to tackle the interlinking, other forms of bigotry that happen along with it. And you cannot separate disability from fatness, you cannot separate disability from race, you cannot separate disability from gender, from sexuality, it all comes together to form who you are as a person. And if we want this more caring, more accessible Boston in the future, we need to tackle everything.\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 82,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n  \"words\": \"Yeah. I guess I just wanted to chime in, and I've been thinking as I've been listening to everyone talking, what does fully accessible inclusive look like to me? It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things. The alternate system to policing for mental health. Like, Sonya Massey comes to mind immediately among Elijah McClain, among other people, like just...

And I think also not infantilizing disability, because I feel sometimes the fear is that if you disclose, you loose agency. And I know a girl who said, as soon as she told her doctor like, \\\"Oh, I have autism,\\\" the doctor immediately just started talking to the husband and completely ignoring her. And when she's like, \\\"Hey, talk to me,\\\" it's like, \\\"What, do I have to sedate you?\\\" And I was like, \\\"That's really, really scary.\\\" So I feel just recognizing that people with disabilities or disabled people, we're still people and we're still adults and not children, even though I feel there's so much infantilizing of so many different autistic traits, and granted, we are a very acute community, but we're also still adults and human.

But agreed about the employment, and then I think a lot of just talking about neurodivergence as well as I think that is a huge factor in work discrimination, but also just trying out different ways to get things done. I think that also just psychiatric incarceration and the threat of that is a big thing in Boston. And when we're talking about the mental health field that is super under...

So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's...

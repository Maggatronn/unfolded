We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across the neighborhoods and communities to build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve that, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared by the members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the City of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as MIT CCC. Thirdly, all conversations that were part of our effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed... Just go into here. There we go.

The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns.

CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities.

Only the research team at the MI CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across the neighborhoods and communities to build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve that, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared by the members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the City of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as MIT CCC. Thirdly, all conversations that were part of our effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed... Just go into here. There we go. That is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, CCC's deployment team. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. Now, the verbal consent part.

CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities.

The recording part that we need is the audio, not the video. So if everyone is okay, I'm going to kick ourselves off with a round of quick introductions.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across the neighborhoods and communities to build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve that, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared by the members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the City of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as MIT CCC. Thirdly, all conversations that were part of our effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed... Just go into here. There we go.

The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across the neighborhoods and communities to build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve that, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared by the members of the Real Talk Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the City of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as MIT CCC. Thirdly, all conversations that were part of our effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed... Just go into here. There we go. That is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico, CCC's deployment team. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and the audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. Now, the verbal consent part. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have that recording data deleted. Only the research team at the MI CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree to this, please say, \\\"I agree.\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 2,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 3,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 4,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Liz\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 5,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 6,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Gray\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 7,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Great, thank you.

Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that comes out that you would like to add or tweak? Okay. One thing that's not on here, because it's a guide for every conversation, I will say, since we are on Zoom and being on camera can get very tiring at times, if you need to save your bandwidth for another meeting or you're just feeling you need some space, feel free to put your camera off. The recording part that we need is the audio, not the video. So if everyone is okay, I'm going to kick ourselves off with a round of quick introductions.

And just so that I can contribute a little bit, I'm also a native Bostonian. On my dad's side, I am third generation and there's definitely a history of family immigrating from Ireland. And my mom grew up in Chicago and my dad met her there. They married and moved back. So third generation on one side, first generation Bostonian on the other. Okay. So thank you all. I hope people are feeling comfortable. Feel free to take some camera time, take space. If something comes up, you can DM me. I want to be open and providing a safe space for everyone, so just let me know if something comes up, okay? I want to/we want to learn more about what it's like living in the city right now. So the prompt is, can you describe a specific time when you felt really supported by your neighborhood, by your community in Boston? I'd love to know who was involved that helped make it special, or what had happened that you felt it was really meaningful.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 24,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Liz\",\n    \"words\": \"I can start off.

And I think that the biggest thing that got me through was that I was already established in mutual aid networks, disability groups, and I think that that really gave me a leg up in just even being able to find specialists, being able to find resources, but also knowing that my experience is unique, but that there's so much common ground. I think that just neighbors friends, people in the community sharing their own experiences was huge to me to feel less isolated in my diagnosis. But then even in terms of picking out mobility aids and just little things like getting groceries, being able to do things like that, I think that my community was a huge part of it.

So that for sure, being able to receive care from them has made a tremendous difference. And then the other thing that comes to mind for me is that I currently attend, and every other week, a chronic illness peer support art therapy group that is just absolutely wonderful.

One of them being that Boston Medical Center has made a tremendous difference in how to... has made a tremendous difference in the degree to which I'm able to participate in my day-to-day life. And when I was living in Ohio and when I was living in Western Massachusetts, I wasn't receiving nearly the quality of care that I'm now receiving from Boston Medical Center. So that for sure, being able to receive care from them has made a tremendous difference. And then the other thing that comes to mind for me is that I currently attend, and every other week, a chronic illness peer support art therapy group that is just absolutely wonderful. It's based in Somerville out of a Somerville art grant I want to say, but it's open to folks from living across Massachusetts. So that group as well has made a tremendous difference to me in feeling... Like they have a community here among other chronically ill and disabled folks, and also because the facilitators is great at infusing a disability justice ethos or practice into the facilitation of the group. So I very much appreciate that.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 28,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Great. Thanks, Madeline. That sounds really interesting.

After my last relationship, getting to know a bunch of other people who just so happened to both be queer and neurodivergent has been great. That's not part of the co-op requirements. It just happened that way and everyone has been so kind. It's been nice to rebuild friendships outside of a romantic context. And then also, the house itself is very old and not very accessible, but everyone has worked with me in so many ways to make it as accessible as possible. For example, we have these old crystal beveled doorknobs that hurt my hands quite a bit when I use them. Ooh, it hurts. And I found silicon covers for them on Amazon and the facilities' manager, without even questioning it, just ordered them for me and then ordered an extra set for my bathroom without me even thinking about it. So yeah, just small things like that have made living in an inaccessible building a lot easier and it's just been very nice.",

So I did not play any sports. Used to cry for PE, was never a part of any team. You know on TV they have those jackets that have the letters? I'm like, \\\"Oh, those look so cool, but I know I'm never going to have one of those.\\\" But it was in the beginning of the year at my job, they gave all staff one of those jackets and put our last name on the back and I was like, \\\"Oh, I'm part of a team. I'm part of an IEP team.\\\" And I just felt really supported in that moment. But I didn't know if you... I'm realizing you meant supported in your disability or... Oh, just in general. Okay.

So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled.

And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service.

Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled.

Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \"Oh, you know we have cameras,\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges.

I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\" or, \"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\" So I worry about that.

I think I was thinking about it very literally. I also live in Beacon Hill and have frequently felt invisible in this neighborhood being not only disabled but low income and not necessarily being the ideal demographic for this area. But in a broader sense of community of Boston as a whole, I spent the last weekend at a retreat for women who have been impacted by community violence or incarceration. And I have not been incarcerated, but my partner was. And it is a very isolating event that happens when someone you love is incarcerated. And so I have spent a lot of time not dealing with that. And at this retreat, there were women from all over the city and there were a couple from out of state, and it was the first time that I felt I could talk about the way that I was impacted as a loved one in a setting where no one was going to judge me or no one was going to look at me funny. And in fact, the opposite happened, I was surrounded by love and comfort and hugs and affirmation, and I think that was just huge for me and that everyone came from such diverse backgrounds and from so many different places really made it feel like home.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 36,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"That's great.

But like I said, I'm sorry, I'm just going on the fly, but I'm glad you could all think of however you define community and what support looks like for you. We're going to go the opposite side and I'm going to ask you about day-to-day worries.

I've been, for lack of a better word, trapped in my job for the last, almost or about a year and a half that I've been working there for up until maybe a couple of months ago, it was becoming progressively more and more... my previous supervisor was becoming progressively more and more aggressively ableist towards me from passive aggression to just straighten up aggressive harassment of me for being a disabled employee effectively. And I know of, at least, many of the resources that I have at my disposal is, for example, one of the resources I thought about a lot of going to is the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, but also this is my first full-time job and I am the lowest ranking person in the office and I'm trans and I'm queer and and I'm disabled. So there are a lot of things going against me if I were to be retaliated against for naming the ways in which this particular supervisor has been extraordinarily violent towards me. So yeah, I don't know, that's something that's been on my mind a lot over the last, now almost about a year and a half, and I have no idea what to do about it except to just... I've been looking for a new job for eight months now, eight or nine months.

I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs.

And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\" And other people are like, \"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\" or, \"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\" So I worry about that.

And I know of, at least, many of the resources that I have at my disposal is, for example, one of the resources I thought about a lot of going to is the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, but also this is my first full-time job and I am the lowest ranking person in the office and I'm trans and I'm queer and and I'm disabled. So there are a lot of things going against me if I were to be retaliated against for naming the ways in which this particular supervisor has been extraordinarily violent towards me.

I am not currently employed. I was in mental health, but then also I worked in the restaurant industry for 13 years and I was working there when I became incredibly sick. I have autonomic dysfunction and the restaurant industry is not accessible at all ever. I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs. I just want to roll.\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 41,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"And so just one more thing that I have that in my circumstance, one of the main barriers that I've run up against being a state employee who has narcolepsy is the, I don't know if they are rules or laws or guidelines or what they are exactly but against, I think the term is waste, fraud, and abuse. So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled.

If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding.

So there are a lot of things going against me if I were to be retaliated against for naming the ways in which this particular supervisor has been extraordinarily violent towards me. So yeah, I don't know, that's something that's been on my mind a lot over the last, now almost about a year and a half, and I have no idea what to do about it except to just... I've been looking for a new job for eight months now, eight or nine months. So yeah, that's where things are currently now with me.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 40,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Liz\",\n    \"words\": \"I can very much relate to that.

I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up.

Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal.

And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well.

So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

So there are a lot of things going against me if I were to be retaliated against for naming the ways in which this particular supervisor has been extraordinarily violent towards me. So yeah, I don't know, that's something that's been on my mind a lot over the last, now almost about a year and a half, and I have no idea what to do about it except to just... I've been looking for a new job for eight months now, eight or nine months.

Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \\\"Oh, you know we have cameras,\\\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \\\"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\\\" And other people are like, \\\"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\\\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \\\"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\\\" or, \\\"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\\\" So I worry about that.

I mean, depending on the service, sometimes even younger than that, but there's just nothing supporting LGBT adults, which is also really frustrating. So being someone who's disabled and a LGBT, I'm in a weird space where there's just not a lot of any kind of support, anything.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 46,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"That's a good point.

I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.\"\n}\n\n**Output instructions:**\nStep 1: Consider the above conversation excerpt.\nStep 2: Consider the current turn and whether it responds to any preceding turn.\nStep 3: If it does, identify the preceding turn id(s) it specifically responds to in the \"link_turn_id\" field.

So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

I've been, for lack of a better word, trapped in my job for the last, almost or about a year and a half that I've been working there for up until maybe a couple of months ago, it was becoming progressively more and more... my previous supervisor was becoming progressively more and more aggressively ableist towards me from passive aggression to just straighten up aggressive harassment of me for being a disabled employee effectively. And I know of, at least, many of the resources that I have at my disposal is, for example, one of the resources I thought about a lot of going to is the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, but also this is my first full-time job and I am the lowest ranking person in the office and I'm trans and I'm queer and and I'm disabled. So there are a lot of things going against me if I were to be retaliated against for naming the ways in which this particular supervisor has been extraordinarily violent towards me. So yeah, I don't know, that's something that's been on my mind a lot over the last, now almost about a year and a half, and I have no idea what to do about it except to just... I've been looking for a new job for eight months now, eight or nine months. So yeah, that's where things are currently now with me.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 40,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Liz\",\n    \"words\": \"I can very much relate to that. I am not currently employed. I was in mental health, but then also I worked in the restaurant industry for 13 years and I was working there when I became incredibly sick. I have autonomic dysfunction and the restaurant industry is not accessible at all ever. I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs. I just want to roll.\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 41,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"And so just one more thing that I have that in my circumstance, one of the main barriers that I've run up against being a state employee who has narcolepsy is the, I don't know if they are rules or laws or guidelines or what they are exactly but against, I think the term is waste, fraud, and abuse. So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled. So that was fun. So a bit more context there.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 42,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Oh, thank you both for being so honest and I complete... well, I haven't had to access it, but working where I do, I understand navigating and the challenges and fearing retaliation. So even though I haven't experienced it, I'm aware of it. So I'm sorry you're both navigating that challenge. If others have employment related worries, they can chime in now or if there are any other worries, you can feel free to raise those as well.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 43,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, I think something that I experience is food insecurity. And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service. So I think that is a place where disability is not being considered at all.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 44,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n    \"words\": \"I am reluctant because, well, some of the things, well, I feel thinking about the things I worry about day to day, I feel those aren't necessarily unique to Boston, but just everyday things, just as a person navigating the world and just how you're going to be perceived or shopping. Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \\\"Oh, you know we have cameras,\\\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \\\"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\\\" And other people are like, \\\"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\\\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \\\"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\\\" or, \\\"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\\\" So I worry about that. But yeah.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 45,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, that actually brings up another thing for me is being heavily involved with LGBT communities in and around the Boston area and then Massachusetts more broadly, I've noticed a pretty substantial pattern where there's a fair amount of resources and services for LGBT youth, but once you hit the age of 25, 26, 27, there's just about nothing once you pass that. I mean, depending on the service, sometimes even younger than that, but there's just nothing supporting LGBT adults, which is also really frustrating. So being someone who's disabled and a LGBT, I'm in a weird space where there's just not a lot of any kind of support, anything.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 46,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"That's a good point. Thank you. Gray, do you have any worries you want to share or should we move on to the more positive, last question?\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 47,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Gray\",\n    \"words\": \"Oh, I can share. I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat.

I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

    "prompt": "**Conversation excerpt:**\n[\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 40,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Liz\",\n    \"words\": \"I can very much relate to that. I am not currently employed. I was in mental health, but then also I worked in the restaurant industry for 13 years and I was working there when I became incredibly sick. I have autonomic dysfunction and the restaurant industry is not accessible at all ever. I've done a lot of work as a manager to reach out to people who might have low energy levels, might only be able to work a three, four hour shift compared to the normal 10 hours, but I'd rather hire people that really need the work and really want that. So I was working part-time as a yoga studio manager. I was working part-time but 30 hours a week and then I was hospitalized for four days due to a chronic illness flare up. And upon return they cut my hours from 30 hours to four hours a week. So that was a huge, huge drop in my income. And that was the same thing I was told, \\\"You can file a notice of discrimination, but if you have been there less than 90 days, nothing's going to happen.\\\" And then also just being in the process of knowing I could go get another job, but then my chronic illness is going to flare up and then will they just fire me again? And right now I'm navigating the... I've applied for disability, but it takes many months and trying to figure out how to not go through my entire savings account. I think I'm very privileged that for many years was able to work full-time and I'm very grateful for that. But yeah, just that unknown of financial insecurity and job security is definitely at the forefront of my mind right now along with housing. It is seemingly impossible to find accessible housing or a lot of times I'm being told that like, \\\"The apartment is accessible, there's just three steps to the front door.\\\" I'm like, \\\"Well then okay, I don't need to be carried up the stairs. I just want to roll.\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 41,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"And so just one more thing that I have that in my circumstance, one of the main barriers that I've run up against being a state employee who has narcolepsy is the, I don't know if they are rules or laws or guidelines or what they are exactly but against, I think the term is waste, fraud, and abuse. So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled. So that was fun. So a bit more context there.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 42,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Oh, thank you both for being so honest and I complete... well, I haven't had to access it, but working where I do, I understand navigating and the challenges and fearing retaliation. So even though I haven't experienced it, I'm aware of it. So I'm sorry you're both navigating that challenge. If others have employment related worries, they can chime in now or if there are any other worries, you can feel free to raise those as well.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 43,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, I think something that I experience is food insecurity. And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service. So I think that is a place where disability is not being considered at all.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 44,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n    \"words\": \"I am reluctant because, well, some of the things, well, I feel thinking about the things I worry about day to day, I feel those aren't necessarily unique to Boston, but just everyday things, just as a person navigating the world and just how you're going to be perceived or shopping. Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \\\"Oh, you know we have cameras,\\\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \\\"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\\\" And other people are like, \\\"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\\\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \\\"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\\\" or, \\\"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\\\" So I worry about that.

I mean, depending on the service, sometimes even younger than that, but there's just nothing supporting LGBT adults, which is also really frustrating.

I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

So there's this understanding, at least in my office, that I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my work shift and it's with the exception of the hour of time that I'm allotted for two 15 minute breaks and one and a half hour of lunch break. Besides that, I have to be actively using my computer all eight hours of my shift five days a week. Otherwise, there's the potential for them to use that rule or law or whatever it is against me, which as someone with narcolepsy, is effectively impossible. And I've asked for... Getting accommodations was a whole process that was just abysmal. So my employer is the UMass Chan Medical School, and then they consult me out to work most of my hours with MassHealth where I work most of my hours. And UMass Medical School apparently consults out their ADA accommodations' staff. It's not actually a part of their HR department. It's a whole other thing that they bring someone in on the occasion when they need someone to handle things. That's terrifying and extremely worrisome as well. But yeah, so that was a whole process that was pretty much entirely ineffective and was over the course of several months because the ADA person kept trying to give me what I call non-accommodation accommodations, which is to say she kept trying to give me things that I already have access to and call them accommodations even though I was seeing her because the things I had access to weren't enough because I was disabled. So that was fun. So a bit more context there.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 42,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Oh, thank you both for being so honest and I complete... well, I haven't had to access it, but working where I do, I understand navigating and the challenges and fearing retaliation. So even though I haven't experienced it, I'm aware of it. So I'm sorry you're both navigating that challenge. If others have employment related worries, they can chime in now or if there are any other worries, you can feel free to raise those as well.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 43,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Kelly\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, I think something that I experience is food insecurity. And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service. So I think that is a place where disability is not being considered at all.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 44,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n    \"words\": \"I am reluctant because, well, some of the things, well, I feel thinking about the things I worry about day to day, I feel those aren't necessarily unique to Boston, but just everyday things, just as a person navigating the world and just how you're going to be perceived or shopping. Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \\\"Oh, you know we have cameras,\\\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \\\"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\\\" And other people are like, \\\"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\\\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \\\"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\\\" or, \\\"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\\\" So I worry about that.

I mean, depending on the service, sometimes even younger than that, but there's just nothing supporting LGBT adults, which is also really frustrating. So being someone who's disabled and a LGBT, I'm in a weird space where there's just not a lot of any kind of support, anything.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 46,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"That's a good point.

I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there.

I think housing, if you don't have a solid foundation, everything else is going to feel shaky. And I definitely think the housing market here...

And so housing, just that elephant in the room is just, it's so important, it's so necessary. It should be a right and it shouldn't be this hard to find safe, accessible, decent housing in this city.",

And while there are a wealth of agencies and individuals doing the work, one thing that I have consistently seen is that disabled people are left out of the conversation, whether it's how early you have to line up to access food, that there's no chairs or shade. If you're outside, there may be no shade, there may be no access to bathrooms, there may be no water. If you are inside, there may be no seats, there are maybe long lines. It may be overwhelming for some people. And so that has consistently been a thing that I have seen for people who are non-mobile, for people who are housebound, there just really aren't any agencies I don't think, or people considering that not everyone is able-bodied. And even if you're able-bodied, not everyone may be able to carry anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds of produce or food items. What else? Not everybody has transportation. Not everybody actually lives close to one of these places. So I think in terms of accessibility and all of the work that is being done in this city, which there is a tremendous amount, I absolutely feel that disability, disability access is not a part of the conversation at all. And I have seen this in working with people in volunteering, there was some support during the pandemic, but those delivery boxes and various things that were available for a brief period during the pandemic, and it was a brief period, those things have disappeared. They just don't exist anymore. Or if they do exist, they've lost funding. So they're on a much, much smaller scale or they're much, much more tailored to a smaller population or a smaller group that they are able to assist or service. So I think that is a place where disability is not being considered at all.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 44,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Alysia\",\n    \"words\": \"I am reluctant because, well, some of the things, well, I feel thinking about the things I worry about day to day, I feel those aren't necessarily unique to Boston, but just everyday things, just as a person navigating the world and just how you're going to be perceived or shopping. Like, I was shopping and an employee told me like, \\\"Oh, you know we have cameras,\\\" as I was going to the fitting room, because maybe she thought I was going to steal something. So I feel those are the things that I worry about most day to day or just interactions with police and things like that. But as far as related to disability, I feel I have a lot of or developed a lot of routines or things that I do to accommodate my challenges. Like, if I had to go to different work sites, the day before or at least once I would go figure out how to get there on public transit and go on the route and write it down. And if I'm in a new building, I would write down where all the different rooms are and have scripts for meetings. I think I do worry about how I'll be perceived as there's huge differences in the way different people view  neurodiversity. Some people are like, \\\"Oh, this is a great strength you have.\\\" And other people are like, \\\"Oh, they will treat you like a child.\\\" So I feel I probably mask a lot to try and not be singled out. But as things I worry about, well occasionally transportation if it... but this is okay, this isn't a daily thing in Boston, but if the T is down, I worry because I rely very heavily on public transit since I don't drive. I think I also worry that there are resources and programs that exist, especially for adult disabilities. I feel there's a lot of things for kids, but it's hard to find programs and things for adults. And I feel I worry that even the things that we have will become harder to access or fade away because sometimes you'll see something online and you'll make a call, it's like, \\\"Oh, we don't do that program anymore,\\\" or, \\\"This isn't available to you for X, Y, and Z.\\\" So I worry about that.

I mean, depending on the service, sometimes even younger than that, but there's just nothing supporting LGBT adults, which is also really frustrating. So being someone who's disabled and a LGBT, I'm in a weird space where there's just not a lot of any kind of support, anything.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 46,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"That's a good point.

I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year. I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 48,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Thanks, Gray.

I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do.

I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary.

So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year.

I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns.

I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns.

I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.",

I'm not very active about sharing because one of my disabilities makes it hard for me to know when to speak in a conversation. So to avoid cutting other people off, I just don't talk until the very end. So yeah, that's why. But honestly, I worry about a lot of disparate things. I worry about money a lot. I'm an SSI recipient. I'm in my 30s and I was declared legally disabled through the courts or whatever when I was 20. So it's been a while, and this is the most expensive place I've ever lived. I learned what very high cost of living means when I moved here. It's like an acronym people use online, talk about where they live. And it's true, it's very expensive to live here. And the only reason I can afford rent is because like I mentioned before, I live in a nonprofit and I also receive a financial hardship scholarship through the nonprofit to live where I do. And I'm constantly worried about homelessness. I have looked into what it would take to live out of a tent and with the Supreme Court ruling about making it essentially illegal to be homeless, that's scary. And even when I don't think about stuff like homelessness, like Kelly mentioned earlier, living in Beacon Hill when you're a low income is difficult. Yeah, yeah, thumbs down. I feel like an alien every time I walk out of where I live and you see these car brands I can't even pronounce, just parked on the street. And the only place that I've gone in Beacon Hill is the library. I don't go into the stores, I don't have the money. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything if I go in. I think I'm not racialized in my appearance, but I have family members who are, and their experiences have rubbed off on me and made me very afraid of policing and things like that. So I worry about it. So it's not a very accommodating neighborhood for people, honestly. And things that would make that better. I mean, making social security income more accessible and then more in accordance with where you live and how much it costs would be fantastic. Having just better awareness and better care community-wise and for your neighbors will be great. Although in Beacon Hill, I don't think most people even live here most of the year.

I think most of these places are empty, honestly. I'm pretty sure one of the apartments that my window faces is on a timer for its lights, so I don't think anyone's even there. But other things I worry about that have already been mentioned are public transit. I am a TAP card user, so I get a discount for my public transit, but it can be a little spotty sometimes or difficult to use. A lot of people also look at someone who is younger and I guess in my case, gay looking, and they're like, \\\"Oh, you probably don't need to sit down,\\\" even though I have a rollator. One time on the Green Line I got on, no one in the disabled seats bothered to get up. Someone in a wheelchair got on right after me, everyone got up and left, even though the person in the wheelchair has a seat, it's built into the mobility aid, had no intention of using the seats, but at least it got me a seat. So just a lack of awareness and knowledge on the T from other riders, especially now that it's tourist season, none of them know that all the seats are for disabled people. And then honestly, this might sound a little like, not petty is the word, but... Sorry, one of my disabilities makes it so that I can't think of words very well. It's simple, simplistic, maybe superficial, but I worry about dating too because my relationship that I got out of was about a decade long, and I wasn't physically disabled back then. I was psychiatrically disabled, and I still am, but I wasn't physically disabled too. And as a member of the queer community, I have had people be interested until they saw my rollator. I have had people be interested until they found out I have heat intolerance and can't go on a five-mile hike when it's 89 degrees out. So it's tough. And then I think more education and more understanding would be great for that too. And you think you would find it in the queer community since people are marginalized in one way, but it doesn't work that way. And then the last thing I'd say I'm worried about as a Bostonian is... Oh shoot, I had it. Well, I can't remember it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, just those are some of my concerns. Yeah, I'd say that's it.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 48,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Thanks, Gray.

I think Liz mentioned this already, but just regarding mobility, just sidewalks being wider so people who have mobility aids or even if it's a cane and you're trying... when there's these huge cracks or the sidewalk is uneven, that can be really challenging. And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\" I'm like, \"All right, I got a mask for you today,\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us. So I think there's just a lot of simple things, but like you said, most of all listening to people with disabilities, I feel. Sorry, I was trying to run through that.

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\" I'm like, \"All right, I got a mask for you today,\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us.

I would go a step further with the team and say that ideally anywhere I want to go should not be further than five minutes away from a T stop somewhere, whether that's a bus and a tram or what have you. I think we should expand it considerably into neighborhoods, into everywhere, basically. Because not everyone can walk. And it's difficult because I don't have the money for an Uber, but sometimes I need one because I just can't physically get to where I'm going. I would also say that a culture of care would be nice, and I don't know how to achieve that, but just a culture where people are more aware of disabilities including hidden invisible disabilities, and people are a little more caring of one another and a little more attentive when they're in public. If they see someone who looks like they could use assistance, but respectfully don't force yourself on them, and just things like that. I think Boston could be more accessible if there were more enthusiasm for disabled workers and students. This is such a college town in a lot of ways. There's just so many institutions here, but I consistently hear from friends and acquaintances at many different institutions that their disabilities are seen as a burden by the institution as something that they have to deal with as more bureaucratic red tape. And it should be met with enthusiasm because you're bringing a new and unique perspective to your institution, so you're actually bringing a gift. And that should also be the same for the workplace as well, I believe. There's probably other stuff I thought of that I forgot about, but that's all that comes to mind right now.",

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \\\"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\\\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled.

There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing.

I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \\\"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\\\" I'm like, \\\"All right, I got a mask for you today,\\\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us.

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness.

It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing.

That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily.

But agreed about the employment, and then I think a lot of just talking about neurodivergence as well as I think that is a huge factor in work discrimination, but also just trying out different ways to get things done. I think that also just psychiatric incarceration and the threat of that is a big thing in Boston. And when we're talking about the mental health field that is super under...

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \\\"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\\\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \\\"You must be able to stand for a long time.\\\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible.

There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing.

And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \\\"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\\\" I'm like, \\\"All right, I got a mask for you today,\\\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us.

And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat.

And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \\\"You must be able to stand for a long time.\\\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible.

And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us.

I think I had a good experience with a medical professional more recently where she had never heard of my chronic illness before, and then the next day she was like, \\\"You've actually taught me a lot and now I feel better suited if someone else comes to the ER with this.\\\" And she acknowledged her lack of knowledge at the beginning and then also how that feedback can improve her work and help better care for individuals.

I can only speak from my own personal experiences, but as a fat person trying to get a hypermobile EDS diagnosis, it has been very difficult because everyone is trained to see hypermobility on thin bodies, and they do not necessarily see the right angles on my body just because I'm larger. And it's tough because I've been told this is one of the best places in the world to receive healthcare, but I have had some of the worst doctors of my life here and truly in many different ways. And I think that in order for the treatment of disabled people to get better overall, we need to tackle the interlinking, other forms of bigotry that happen along with it.

But agreed about the employment, and then I think a lot of just talking about neurodivergence as well as I think that is a huge factor in work discrimination, but also just trying out different ways to get things done. I think that also just psychiatric incarceration and the threat of that is a big thing in Boston. And when we're talking about the mental health field that is super under... We need way more mental health workers. We need to figure out ways to support them so they're not getting burned out right away. But something that is often at the forefront of my mind as someone with autism, ADHD, and PTSD is just, \\\"What if I have a flashback when I'm in public and the cops come?\\\" And just navigating those systems as well, I think is not only traumatic to the disability community, but often really does end in violence.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 74,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Gray\",\n    \"words\": \"Oh, something you said actually reminded me of something I wanted to say, which was I wish that to be more accessible that Boston doctors and medical institutions were less bigoted.

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods. So I feel... I also have an arrhythmia. Not everyone can stand for a very long time, or some people have [inaudible]. There's so many simple things that you can do to make a job accessible. Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\" I'm like, \"All right, I got a mask for you today,\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us. So I think there's just a lot of simple things, but like you said, most of all listening to people with disabilities, I feel. Sorry, I was trying to run through that.

And it's difficult because I don't have the money for an Uber, but sometimes I need one because I just can't physically get to where I'm going. I would also say that a culture of care would be nice, and I don't know how to achieve that, but just a culture where people are more aware of disabilities including hidden invisible disabilities, and people are a little more caring of one another and a little more attentive when they're in public. If they see someone who looks like they could use assistance, but respectfully don't force yourself on them, and just things like that. I think Boston could be more accessible if there were more enthusiasm for disabled workers and students. This is such a college town in a lot of ways. There's just so many institutions here, but I consistently hear from friends and acquaintances at many different institutions that their disabilities are seen as a burden by the institution as something that they have to deal with as more bureaucratic red tape. And it should be met with enthusiasm because you're bringing a new and unique perspective to your institution, so you're actually bringing a gift.

And also sometimes if there's not a crosswalk light, if you are in a seated position, cars might not be able to see when you're crossing. That can be dangerous and scary. And I know Kelly mentioned housing and obviously the solution would be obviously better housing and more affordable housing, but also not criminalizing people who are experiencing houselessness. And I know Gray mentioned just more awareness as far as disabilities in general, but even invisible disabilities where I think like you said, someone could take the seat. It's like, \"Oh, you should give that seat up for someone who's disabled.\" It's like, you don't know that that person who's sitting there isn't disabled. And then I think regarding jobs in Boston, there's so many job descriptions where it'll be like, \"You must be able to stand for a long time.\" And it's like, there's no reason a cashier can't sit while also checking out your goods.

Because the person can actually do the job, but they'll put these little phrases in the job description that exclude people. Also signs. There are many roads in Boston that aren't sign and you'll know and the road's names change sometimes halfway through, which is very confusing. I mean, that's obviously not something to do with change. It's okay. But for some roads don't have signs, and that can be really confusing. And I think in sometimes buildings, I'm visiting a mall and there was just very, very long corridors and there's nowhere to sit, just a bench for somebody who don't have the stamina to keep going or just to sit for a little bit I feel would be really helpful. And then this is something more for schools, but I feel sometimes sensory tools are seen as a luxury or a toy or a distraction when some kids and adults actually use them to focus and that's actually helping them be successful. And then in the workplace, I think the ideas of what professionalism is can restrict people. I look at the performance rubric that I get, for example, and one of them was like, \"Oh, shows appropriate professional eye contacts.\" I'm like, \"All right, I got a mask for you today,\" which I can do, but it shouldn't be that way. And then I think there's a lot of simple things places can do to make their spaces more inclusive or just simple things you can modify. And I'm thinking of my office mate who also has autism and ADHD, we got lamps and LED lights and foam spiders to put under the door to block out the outside noise, and then we could turn off our lights and just use lamps. That's something just we did on our own. But there's so many simple things that you could, even if it's a restaurant space, if they have an area that's quieter lighting or a quieter space that could really help people who get overstimulated easily. And I know at work people just think we're doing it for our students, because we work in special education, which it is for the students, but also for us. So I think there's just a lot of simple things, but like you said, most of all listening to people with disabilities, I feel. Sorry, I was trying to run through that.

I think that also just psychiatric incarceration and the threat of that is a big thing in Boston. And when we're talking about the mental health field that is super under... We need way more mental health workers. We need to figure out ways to support them so they're not getting burned out right away.

So I think sometimes if you're not presenting in the way it's expected or people will assume, \"Oh, you're faking,\" or \"You're attention seeking,\" or \"You're being dramatic.\" It's like, no, they actually feel like they can't breathe. Or also the fact that people can have a condition, but they haven't been diagnosed yet because of access. So I feel people who have PTSD, they had PTSD before they're officially diagnosed with it or other disabilities that some of us have, if you're later diagnosed, you had it the whole time, but you didn't get that until later. And sometimes if they don't see that on paper, they won't necessarily believe you. And like you said, I feel, well, believing women in healthcare, I feel t's just a big issue in general. But listening but also recognizing it's hard. Part of me wants to say removing the fear, but I feel the fear's not going to go away until the system changes. But I feel one reason regarding mental health people don't want to reach out for services is what can happen if you do and you're not listened to? Or like you said, being forcibly admitted. And I know when I was in grad school, I think there was a period where there was depression and having some thoughts, but I was terrified to reach out because I was afraid of what would happen. And luckily, I'm blessed. I have a really supportive family and community, so I was able to talk to people and get support. But there was a clinic right there on campus, but I was terrified of getting forced in. And because I've heard of stories like that, and I know people who things like that have happened to. And I think also not infantilizing disability, because I feel sometimes the fear is that if you disclose, you loose agency. And I know a girl who said, as soon as she told her doctor like, \"Oh, I have autism,\" the doctor immediately just started talking to the husband and completely ignoring her.

Or also the fact that people can have a condition, but they haven't been diagnosed yet because of access. So I feel people who have PTSD, they had PTSD before they're officially diagnosed with it or other disabilities that some of us have, if you're later diagnosed, you had it the whole time, but you didn't get that until later. And sometimes if they don't see that on paper, they won't necessarily believe you. And like you said, I feel, well, believing women in healthcare, I feel t's just a big issue in general. But listening but also recognizing it's hard. Part of me wants to say removing the fear, but I feel the fear's not going to go away until the system changes. But I feel one reason regarding mental health people don't want to reach out for services is what can happen if you do and you're not listened to? Or like you said, being forcibly admitted. And I know when I was in grad school, I think there was a period where there was depression and having some thoughts, but I was terrified to reach out because I was afraid of what would happen. And luckily, I'm blessed. I have a really supportive family and community, so I was able to talk to people and get support. But there was a clinic right there on campus, but I was terrified of getting forced in. And because I've heard of stories like that, and I know people who things like that have happened to. And I think also not infantilizing disability, because I feel sometimes the fear is that if you disclose, you loose agency. And I know a girl who said, as soon as she told her doctor like, \"Oh, I have autism,\" the doctor immediately just started talking to the husband and completely ignoring her. And when she's like, \"Hey, talk to me,\" it's like, \"What, do I have to sedate you?\" And I was like, \"That's really, really scary.\" So I feel just recognizing that people with disabilities or disabled people, we're still people and we're still adults and not children, even though I feel there's so much infantilizing of so many different autistic traits, and granted, we are a very acute community, but we're also still adults and human.

I would go a step further with the team and say that ideally anywhere I want to go should not be further than five minutes away from a T stop somewhere, whether that's a bus and a tram or what have you. I think we should expand it considerably into neighborhoods, into everywhere, basically. Because not everyone can walk. And it's difficult because I don't have the money for an Uber, but sometimes I need one because I just can't physically get to where I'm going. I would also say that a culture of care would be nice, and I don't know how to achieve that, but just a culture where people are more aware of disabilities including hidden invisible disabilities, and people are a little more caring of one another and a little more attentive when they're in public. If they see someone who looks like they could use assistance, but respectfully don't force yourself on them, and just things like that. I think Boston could be more accessible if there were more enthusiasm for disabled workers and students. This is such a college town in a lot of ways. There's just so many institutions here, but I consistently hear from friends and acquaintances at many different institutions that their disabilities are seen as a burden by the institution as something that they have to deal with as more bureaucratic red tape. And it should be met with enthusiasm because you're bringing a new and unique perspective to your institution, so you're actually bringing a gift.

It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things. The alternate system to policing for mental health. Like, Sonya Massey comes to mind immediately among Elijah McClain, among other people, like just... So yeah, so I envision for me that Boston requires people like us to be in the room.",

It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis.

It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things.

Gray, I also have hypermobile, EDS, and autonomic dysfunction, and it's just, it's amazing because once again, it's like it... I don't mind sharing with my providers the symptoms and what's helped me navigate the illness and things like that, but it can often be problematic. Again, we're putting the responsibility on the person who is most impacted to educate others. That's something that I think when I first received my diagnosis, I did not have the energy or the will to explain it to anyone, and I was like, \\\"Please, just look it up. I'm tired.\\\" But yeah, very interesting.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 77,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah.

And then the second provider was just generally terrible in a lot of different ways, but one of the main ones being that he kept attributing my sleep disorder to my depression or my PTSD, but he wasn't taking me seriously.

So I think sometimes if you're not presenting in the way it's expected or people will assume, \\\"Oh, you're faking,\\\" or \\\"You're attention seeking,\\\" or \\\"You're being dramatic.\\\" It's like, no, they actually feel like they can't breathe. Or also the fact that people can have a condition, but they haven't been diagnosed yet because of access. So I feel people who have PTSD, they had PTSD before they're officially diagnosed with it or other disabilities that some of us have, if you're later diagnosed, you had it the whole time, but you didn't get that until later. And sometimes if they don't see that on paper, they won't necessarily believe you. And like you said, I feel, well, believing women in healthcare, I feel t's just a big issue in general. But listening but also recognizing it's hard. Part of me wants to say removing the fear, but I feel the fear's not going to go away until the system changes. But I feel one reason regarding mental health people don't want to reach out for services is what can happen if you do and you're not listened to? Or like you said, being forcibly admitted. And I know when I was in grad school, I think there was a period where there was depression and having some thoughts, but I was terrified to reach out because I was afraid of what would happen. And luckily, I'm blessed. I have a really supportive family and community, so I was able to talk to people and get support. But there was a clinic right there on campus, but I was terrified of getting forced in. And because I've heard of stories like that, and I know people who things like that have happened to. And I think also not infantilizing disability, because I feel sometimes the fear is that if you disclose, you loose agency. And I know a girl who said, as soon as she told her doctor like, \\\"Oh, I have autism,\\\" the doctor immediately just started talking to the husband and completely ignoring her. And when she's like, \\\"Hey, talk to me,\\\" it's like, \\\"What, do I have to sedate you?\\\" And I was like, \\\"That's really, really scary.\\\" So I feel just recognizing that people with disabilities or disabled people, we're still people and we're still adults and not children, even though I feel there's so much infantilizing of so many different autistic traits, and granted, we are a very acute community, but we're also still adults and human.

And another thing that comes to mind is the dire need for safer alternatives to policing, both in Boston and more broadly, I think it's in Cambridge or Somerville, I think there's something called the H.E.A.R.T. Program, which is a safer alternative to the policing system there.

It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things.

Or also the fact that people can have a condition, but they haven't been diagnosed yet because of access.

I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting.

One of them being the overlap of being transgender and autistic is that there is a widespread phenomenon where medical providers will refuse to provide trans autistic folks with the access to gender-affirming healthcare because they're autistic, because they're infantilized and because they are assumed to not be able to give informed consent. And another thing that comes to mind is the dire need for safer alternatives to policing, both in Boston and more broadly, I think it's in Cambridge or Somerville, I think there's something called the H.E.A.R.T. Program, which is a safer alternative to the policing system there. But that needs to also be instituted in Boston as well, both for disabled folks who are maybe having reactions to one thing or another, but also for our communities more broadly, to have safer alternatives for folks to turn to than just the police.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 80,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Yes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 81,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Madeline\",\n    \"words\": \"And the other thing that comes to mind...

It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis. And I'm not talking about the people who are loading their wheelchairs with their possession, which is also valid, but I'm talking about the people out there with colostomy bags and missing limbs and very physical disabilities that make lack of how... that are completely and totally piled on by the lack of housing, and which is not to diminish anyone who's experiencing mental health issues, who may be out there self-medicating or because they can't get the support they need from the system because the system doesn't understand because there's nobody who's... So all of those things, I'm thinking about vulnerable populations in this city who are not being served, and the mention of BMC, just the intersection of all of these things.

It looks like no more NIMBY votes is what it looks like to me. It looks like Mass. and Cass being decentralized. It looks like fruit forests on the common for seasonally appropriate fruits. It looks like finding a way to encourage property owners to shift from empty offices to housing. It looks like massively expanded mental health care. It looks like food access being more equitable. It looks like more accessible T that maybe runs 24 hours and has more service because life doesn't stop overnight, especially for the pretty much low income people who do those overnight labor jobs and still need to get home or to their early morning shift. I think that, yeah, I mean, it looks like a place where housing is equitable and accessible, where food is a right and not a privilege, where healthcare allows you to have some choice, even if you have to rely on a state or federally funded program. As someone who is disabled receives SSDI and has been on Medicare for quite a few years as well as Medicaid, it has been incredibly dehumanizing to have people who have never experienced the health conditions that I've experienced and currently endure to make decisions from a cushy office in Washington that will have very drastic effects on my life without ever having spoken to someone who their policies are directly impacting. So it really means that we start to bring the people closest to the pain, as Ayanna Pressley said, more closer to the power, and that we include people in the room whose lives are going to be impacted by the policies being enacted, because we'll never get that fully accessible and inclusive Boston or Massachusetts or country if we don't start listening to people. I really loved Gray's comment about not being able to separate disability from a lot of things, is that I was thinking about the number of disabled people that I see on Mass. and Cass on a regular basis.

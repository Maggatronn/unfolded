We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive city. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build the connection and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become a part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the other conservations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with the members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations like DLC in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3.

I have needed a wheelchair for a long time, wasn't able to get one until earlier this year. And one of the first things that I did after being able to leave my house was a political action where a group of people, we, I guess, occupied a building to keep it from being evicted. And it was a moment in time that only ended up lasting maybe two or three days, but where I was living, physically living in a space that was completely controlled and organized by just the people living there. We didn't have a landlord that we were... We were building this living space for ourselves. And the level of... There's just so many little things about living with a disability that when I was in that space and in that building where if I couldn't make food for myself, somebody else was happily going to do it. And people were constantly being really hyper aware of everyone's accessibility needs and where I felt like I had a lot to offer. People were really... I felt very, these were strangers also, I felt like my strengths, which are not physical, but more interpersonal and organizational. I haven't been in a living situation where those are the things that are valued because yeah, I can't do the chores, but because it was part of this bigger project, there were tons of other things that I could do. And I felt really, I guess just worthy of being there.

I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \\\"Normal people,\\\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that.

I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult.

I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult.

As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \\\"Normal people,\\\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that.

It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \\\"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\\\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \\\"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\\\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \\\"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\\\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \\\"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\\\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \\\"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\\\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \\\"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\\\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \\\"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\\\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions. But at that second job, I wasn't going to tell them directly that I had any neurological psychiatric issues because I knew what happened the last time I did that.\"\n}\n\n**Output instructions:**\nStep 1: Consider the above, in which Whitney responds to Caitlin.\nStep 2: Identify the part of Speaker Turn 2 that specifically responds to something in the previous turn.

Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \\\"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\\\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \\\"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\\\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \\\"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\\\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \\\"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\\\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \\\"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\\\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \\\"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\\\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \\\"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\\\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions.

And by law you're required to put in a ramp if you do a certain percentage of a thing. And I contacted them and they said... And then got nowhere. Then I decided that you can actually file a complaint in the government and in writing so then they have to respond.

And also they have to take a bus and then there's an hour before the next bus comes.\\\" And a few times people would say to me, \\\"Do you mind mailing this or doing that kind of stuff?\\\" And I didn't mind do it, but they have a right to have privacy and they're giving me their money and trusting. I did the bitchy thing of going up the food chain and there's now actually accessible, there's now a ramp. At first they said they couldn't put one in.

But there is no opportunity at work to say, \\\"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\\\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \\\"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\\\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \\\"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\\\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \\\"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\\\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \\\"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\\\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \\\"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\\\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions. But at that second job, I wasn't going to tell them directly that I had any neurological psychiatric issues because I knew what happened the last time I did that.\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 74,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Jack\",\n  \"words\": \"Yeah, yeah.

Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly.

They said, \\\"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\\\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \\\"Oh, you don't look it,\\\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too.

Probably before I became disabled I actually became independent about my own insurance. Actually it has changed. It changed over time. The reason why I did that was because I want to be an independent therapist, social worker. I did so many years under other facilities and corporate, I didn't like it. I went from management to individual to group everything in between and different jobs. I didn't like it that I was willing to pay on my own pocket to get it, but it actually got much better within 10 years. And this was like 30 years ago. If you're... I was telling a friend that is actually going through a job, he actually... There is a stigma regarding about mental health. I met him 30 years ago. He's around how old I am. And he had a meltdown, that's how we didn't work out for us. And he was working there and he actually lost a job, but he never had any issues later on and stuff. There is a stigma there, but now he's been looking for a job. There's a discrimination also with being older too. Getting a job, he's been in out of jobs for the last two years and stuff and it's been really difficult and struggling that being a man and being Asian, old-fashioned style, the culture really makes emphasis input on it. Whitney, it's not anyone here it's just unfortunately the world we live in is just making a buck for them right now. And they do every three months to change over because they don't want to pay insurance, they don't want to pay people vacation, don't give them comp time. And there's so many people out there out of work that don't want to work for themselves because the governments not helping them anymore. Basically as I noticed, because I go on different Zooms helping people out throughout town, different countries, and different states. I know it's somewhat still going on and stuff. I have few patients myself, I still see and do things. But yes, it's not the very friendly world we live in now. Everyone's just to themselves doing things. It's been more difficult with people that are disabled and stuff by the way of doing things or going through the process of it.

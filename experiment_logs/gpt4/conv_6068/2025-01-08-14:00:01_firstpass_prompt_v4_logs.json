We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive city. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build the connection and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become a part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the other conservations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with the members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations like DLC in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across different conversations and allow users to search, listen to audio snippets, and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. This is the consent part.

You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is completely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected, and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive city. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build the connection and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become a part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the other conservations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with the members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations like DLC in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities, and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding and a stronger, more inclusive city. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build the connection and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become a part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with the other conservations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with the members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations like DLC in the city of Boston, and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, otherwise known as C3. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the nonprofit organization, Cortico C3's deployment arm. The Fora system creates a transcript for each recorded conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across different conversations and allow users to search, listen to audio snippets, and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. This is the consent part. I'm going to read the consent and ask everyone verbal consent at the end. Okay. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. C3 will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is completely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at MIT C3 will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected, and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable. Do you consent to this? If you understand and agree, please say, I agree.",

I have needed a wheelchair for a long time, wasn't able to get one until earlier this year. And one of the first things that I did after being able to leave my house was a political action where a group of people, we, I guess, occupied a building to keep it from being evicted. And it was a moment in time that only ended up lasting maybe two or three days, but where I was living, physically living in a space that was completely controlled and organized by just the people living there. We didn't have a landlord that we were... We were building this living space for ourselves. And the level of... There's just so many little things about living with a disability that when I was in that space and in that building where if I couldn't make food for myself, somebody else was happily going to do it. And people were constantly being really hyper aware of everyone's accessibility needs and where I felt like I had a lot to offer. People were really...

And one of the first things that I did after being able to leave my house was a political action where a group of people, we, I guess, occupied a building to keep it from being evicted. And it was a moment in time that only ended up lasting maybe two or three days, but where I was living, physically living in a space that was completely controlled and organized by just the people living there. We didn't have a landlord that we were... We were building this living space for ourselves. And the level of... There's just so many little things about living with a disability that when I was in that space and in that building where if I couldn't make food for myself, somebody else was happily going to do it. And people were constantly being really hyper aware of everyone's accessibility needs and where I felt like I had a lot to offer. People were really... I felt very, these were strangers also, I felt like my strengths, which are not physical, but more interpersonal and organizational. I haven't been in a living situation where those are the things that are valued because yeah, I can't do the chores, but because it was part of this bigger project, there were tons of other things that I could do.

I was diagnosed, took 20 years diagnosed, there's no cure, no treatment, just connect the lines to get the symptoms. And I had to stop work. I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \"Normal people,\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that.

I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic.

I was diagnosed, took 20 years diagnosed, there's no cure, no treatment, just connect the lines to get the symptoms. And I had to stop work. I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \"Normal people,\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that.

Going back to my moving again situation. Being disabled, my disability is a genetic one. I was diagnosed, took 20 years diagnosed, there's no cure, no treatment, just connect the lines to get the symptoms. And I had to stop work. I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \\\"Normal people,\\\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that. You have to find different outlets and the frustration of that. It's just very, very difficult and trying to survive on that.

I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \\\"Normal people,\\\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that. You have to find different outlets and the frustration of that. It's just very, very difficult and trying to survive on that.

And I found that even when I was an advocate, I ran into so many roadblocks. We were lucky enough when we moved to Boston that... It's hard to believe, we were living in a three-family. And then we started to look for a house and our three-family went up for sale and we were able to buy a three-family for 173,000.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 63,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Wow.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 64,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Jen\",\n    \"words\": \"Can't even... Some cars cost more than that now. That was a real stretch for us financially. The first thing that I wanted to do was actually try to turn the first floor into an accessible apartment because as everybody knows, especially back in the '90s, there was very limited accessible housing and just hit roadblock after roadblock with the city of Boston that we weren't able to do it. And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \\\"increase\\\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \\\"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\\\" And their response to me is, \\\"Why do you need it?\\\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \\\"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\\\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it. And I just find that there's so many roadblocks. And I'm fortunate because English is my first language. I'm educated, I work in social services. I'm a citizen, so I don't have to worry about speaking up because somebody might report me. I'm white. I have so much privilege and yet still nothing, very little changes. For West Roxbury now there's, I even measured, there's 0.2 miles where there's not one on street accessible parking space and there used to be two in that area and have tried going through all sorts of avenues and nothing happens. Tried contacting the mayor's office, that was useless.

I was diagnosed, took 20 years diagnosed, there's no cure, no treatment, just connect the lines to get the symptoms. And I had to stop work. I was a workaholic and I'm in the mental health field, also do holistic. I have two herniated discs and I can't straight out my knees and stuff. It became very difficult. In the process of me had to move because the situation happened where I was living with family and I tried many times, didn't quite work. I realized I had to move out. I was looking for places and stuff, and there's a lot of discrimination and everything unfortunately for people disabled. If you're called thing SSDI, they don't want someone like that. And then on top of mental health, you get the double whammy so they don't want you. And also because I'm much older, so they have the stigma, which is horrible. I went over, I looked at all different areas, finding place from roommates, I gone to different towns as well to doing connections. And the final connection I had was with my mom's church, which I haven't gone to. She'd been with only the last few years and stuff. That's how I got the place friends through friends and connections like that. But I went over 90 something and I had to do within two weeks because know about my story and stuff because I had to change last minute stuff, something just, excuse my language, shit hit the roof and you just have to get out because it wasn't healthy from the place and stuff. Being disabled it's be more difficult because you're battling your symptoms and your condition, so I have mentally and physically and stuff, and trying to do it on your own and juggling everything with all the pressure on you at the place you're at is very, very difficult on top of it when you don't sleep and everything. Looking online through Facebook, connections and everything and stuff, then you had to all your pride and through a mom's, the irony is I went through my mom's church and they were more supportive than me than what my mom. That's how I got the place and stuff. But it took six months for me to try to get out of the situation because I tried to make it work out and stuff, but the family wasn't supportive and my mom was much older, so I got out of that. But yeah, so it was very difficult place. Then I tried, as I said roommates and stuff. It's just really very, very difficult do it on your own and stuff and much later in life and you don't expect things happen, but things to happen, you have to find new outlets and be open-minded and be positive about situation, move forward and stuff. But again, everyone's doing at their own pace and stuff. I tend to do better stuff when I do on my own than other people because so sensitive, I pick up their energy and stuff, then it gets me more stressed out. My mind was always fight and flight response because my condition makes me do that, fear stuff. Since that, then having them react on it, because the situation, even though I know it already, you understand what I'm saying, it gives me the extra nervousness. Then what happens, my system, in past it shuts down so go unconscious. I try to do on my own, meditate and pray a lot and do stuff. But it is what it is. But yeah, the situation is... Yeah, so I'd say that's difficult. Ongoing, I think different towns are different because I was try to find information through housing and stuff and we're put in with other people because other people, immigrants is the people coming over. Being disabled is very more difficult. And I usually live, before... I moved six times now since Covid and stuff, the nightmare before that. It's a frustrating situation. You don't think about it until you act on it then you move forward. You not try and count too much, otherwise you can stress yourself out and gets more traumatic and more problematic. As you said, you move forward. I used to be living in government housing for five years and stuff. Then they got sold when Covid happened. I was living there, I thought, okay, I'm all set with the disabled people and older people. I was working with old people anyways when I was a social worker, case manager before my disability. And so it was fine, but when they sold it and when I left that place, it was very horrible. I had a stalker and was horrible, horrible situation. Now I start all over again and dealing with it, not getting support from different towns and funding, it's very problematic. And you're fighting with people that are regular, normal people. \"Normal people,\" you know what I'm saying? And we don't get any extra treatments stuff, they just throw us all in with that.

And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \"increase\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\" And their response to me is, \"Why do you need it?\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it.

But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions.

And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \"increase\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\" And their response to me is, \"Why do you need it?\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it. And I just find that there's so many roadblocks. And I'm fortunate because English is my first language. I'm educated, I work in social services. I'm a citizen, so I don't have to worry about speaking up because somebody might report me. I'm white. I have so much privilege and yet still nothing, very little changes.

It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions. But at that second job, I wasn't going to tell them directly that I had any neurological psychiatric issues because I knew what happened the last time I did that.",

It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions. But at that second job, I wasn't going to tell them directly that I had any neurological psychiatric issues because I knew what happened the last time I did that.",

And it varies as to how mobile I am. And I come at it from two angles because long before having an disability, I used to be somebody who was a strong advocate for people with disabilities. And I found that even when I was an advocate, I ran into so many roadblocks. We were lucky enough when we moved to Boston that... It's hard to believe, we were living in a three-family.

Some cars cost more than that now. That was a real stretch for us financially. The first thing that I wanted to do was actually try to turn the first floor into an accessible apartment because as everybody knows, especially back in the '90s, there was very limited accessible housing and just hit roadblock after roadblock with the city of Boston that we weren't able to do it. And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \\\"increase\\\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \\\"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\\\" And their response to me is, \\\"Why do you need it?\\\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \\\"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\\\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it. And I just find that there's so many roadblocks. And I'm fortunate because English is my first language. I'm educated, I work in social services. I'm a citizen, so I don't have to worry about speaking up because somebody might report me. I'm white. I have so much privilege and yet still nothing, very little changes. For West Roxbury now there's, I even measured, there's 0.2 miles where there's not one on street accessible parking space and there used to be two in that area and have tried going through all sorts of avenues and nothing happens.

And I found that even when I was an advocate, I ran into so many roadblocks. We were lucky enough when we moved to Boston that... It's hard to believe, we were living in a three-family.

It's interesting because for example, when I lived out in Western Mass, I lived in Amherst and the downtown area of Amherst had an apartment building that was subsidized and had people that were older and then people with disabilities and they did a major renovation of the post office but didn't put in a ramp. And by law you're required to put in a ramp if you do a certain percentage of a thing. And I contacted them and they said... And then got nowhere. Then I decided that you can actually file a complaint in the government and in writing so then they have to respond. And then the response to me was, \\\"Well, the post office outside of town is accessible.\\\" And I'm like, \\\"Yes, but first of all, people don't live out there.

But it shouldn't be that hard.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 67,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, it shouldn't have to come to that. But thanks Jen, I appreciate you sharing. I want to give space for Jack and Whitney. I know Whitney, you expressed frustration with employment before. You mentioned supports.

It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \\\"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\\\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \\\"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\\\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \\\"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\\\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \\\"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\\\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \\\"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\\\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \\\"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\\\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \\\"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\\\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions.

The first thing that I wanted to do was actually try to turn the first floor into an accessible apartment because as everybody knows, especially back in the '90s, there was very limited accessible housing and just hit roadblock after roadblock with the city of Boston that we weren't able to do it. And that was really frustrating. And continue to hit roadblocks now that I advocate for myself, an example being that I'm very fortunate I can drive, but I use accessible parking. And the city of Boston implemented these bike lanes in some communities and they implemented that in West Roxbury downtown. And as a result, they \"increase\" the number of accessible parking spaces by taking the ones out of the central business area and putting them way out of the area and putting it in places in front of where the only businesses is the CVS. And if I need accessible parking, I could park in the CVS parking lot with accessible parking. I don't need to park on the street. And West Roxbury downtown business lost a lot of accessible parking. And I tried to work with the disability commission and it was so frustrating. It was basically they offered a meeting and I could have not showed up because they'd already made their decision before I spoke. And other issues that have come up, the city isn't always great at monitoring people who are parking accessible parking who don't have a placard. And I've constantly, frequently, not constantly frequently called the police to ask them to monitor. And then I called them one time and I said, \"Not only do you not monitor, but you have a police car sitting in front of the police station in an accessible parking space.\" And their response to me is, \"Why do you need it?\" And it's like, that's not the issue whether or not I need it because actually I don't need it. I was driving by, but you shouldn't be there. There's a parking lot in the police department and there's a lot of parking in that area. And I've tried to work a lot with Starbucks because, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but when they started their mobile order program, people just run in to get their coffee. They run in and they say, \"I'm only going to be five minutes, I'll just park in the accessible parking space.\" And have tried to get Starbucks, they won't monitor them, but at least tried to get corporate to put signs up that remind people that this is for people with disabilities, not for people going in with mobile orders and they just won't do it.

But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon.

Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served.

I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem.

It's interesting because for example, when I lived out in Western Mass, I lived in Amherst and the downtown area of Amherst had an apartment building that was subsidized and had people that were older and then people with disabilities and they did a major renovation of the post office but didn't put in a ramp. And by law you're required to put in a ramp if you do a certain percentage of a thing. And I contacted them and they said... And then got nowhere. Then I decided that you can actually file a complaint in the government and in writing so then they have to respond. And then the response to me was, \\\"Well, the post office outside of town is accessible.\\\" And I'm like, \\\"Yes, but first of all, people don't live out there. And also they have to take a bus and then there's an hour before the next bus comes.\\\" And a few times people would say to me, \\\"Do you mind mailing this or doing that kind of stuff?\\\" And I didn't mind do it, but they have a right to have privacy and they're giving me their money and trusting. I did the bitchy thing of going up the food chain and there's now actually accessible, there's now a ramp. At first they said they couldn't put one in. I'm like, \\\"Yes, you can.\\\" I actually told them where you could put it, and now that's actually where the ramp is. But it shouldn't be that hard.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 67,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, it shouldn't have to come to that. But thanks Jen, I appreciate you sharing. I want to give space for Jack and Whitney. I know Whitney, you expressed frustration with employment before. You mentioned supports. Do you think there's anything you want to, what's that word, touch upon that more or do you think there's another worry you have?\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 68,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Whitney\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah, well I think in this similar way as Jen, I've also been proactive about my problem. It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \\\"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\\\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \\\"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\\\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \\\"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\\\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \\\"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\\\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \\\"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\\\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \\\"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\\\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \\\"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\\\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions.

It's not like I'm just sitting in a corner and I'm like, oh, people should come to me and help me. When you're a child that's when they should have done that. Yes. But that didn't happen for me either. My reading disability was not recognized or acted upon. I could not have possibly had any ADHD because that was a problem that boys with too much energy had and not quiet children like me. Everybody played dumb in the school system and they still do because that's who I encounter, that's who I work with. And so it's almost as if you are refusing to see something that's right in front of you, the further removed you are from the people who are actually experiencing the problem, the more leeway you have to plead ignorance and say, \"I don't understand that situation. That's not mine.\" But there should be some kind of mixing together of people where they are forced to see my disability as much as I'm forced to see what the norm is, what the status quo is. But there is no opportunity at work to say, \"The size of this class affects my organizational skills and compromises my ability to give thoughtful attention to each student,\" because that's not something that they've considered or identified as one of their goals. And so I don't think that in the public system, public schools being one place, there is an interest in better understanding how all people can be served. And that is the whole point of public services. That's the point of the library. My mom is a reference librarian and she would not be able to turn somebody away and say, \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question.\" She works to find it. But in other parts of the city, other parts of government jobs, there's no obligation to comply or meet expectation because there's no expectation. It's like those people, the ones who should be enforcing those expectations are the ones who are deciding the expectations. What I did when I came to my second job was I made a list of all the things that I wanted to improve upon because I knew I was going to have two evaluations that year. I had a working document that I shared with both of my evaluators and early on in the year I said, \"Well, these are my goals that I've identified so far. If you could please keep these in mind when you do my evaluations, my informal observations, formal, please do, and I would love to hear your comments.\" And so that happened once, but when I followed up again several months, I said, \"It's been several months since I've had an observation. I just wanted to check in, see how I've progressed on these things.\" Well, they'd only been in my classroom twice from September through January. Whether or not they were even in place to tell me what I was doing wrong or what I was doing better, it's almost like they weren't. By the end of the year they told me that they didn't do a final observation, final formal observation, but they did give me a final evaluation, which doesn't make sense. On top of it, they presented to me their final evaluation after they told me that my contract would not be renewed. That tells me that their decision was not based on anything concrete. I think that, long story short, there were a lot of things that were noticed about how I work and how I think that were not important enough for them to work with me on because this happened repeatedly where I lost my job. And instead they can just turn around and say, \"Well, we'll hire somebody else.\" But what's the point when you have somebody who is willing to work on improving themselves and who is open-minded about it and who will work with you, why just say, \"Okay, we're going to get rid of you,\" instead of actually facing the problem. Yes, it might be a little different for me. Maybe I would've needed some smaller classes or I would've needed more time to do progress reports or I would've needed to debrief more often with my supervisor. But those were not opportunities. Those were things that it was almost as if too to ask for. You have to be careful when you don't have tenure what you say and how much you push and how much you voice your opinions.

And I guess I just wanted to offer some solidarity that those anxieties that you're experiencing not only are my life as well, but I think, I guess I was a bit surprised to hear you say that because I feel like most of the people in my immediate circle and I guess and secondary and tertiary circles as well are in the same or a similar place in terms of the job market and I don't know, surviving. I guess I think for me the biggest, most central anxiety that I have is around the survival of my community. I am trans and trans people die. That is my experience as somebody who's primary community is queer and trans people is that there's just a lot of loss and a lot of death that is very avoidable and really tied to the housing crisis in terms of the housing crisis and the lack of access to medical care by which I'm not even referring to gender-affirming care, I'm just referring to medical care. But obviously it's all part of that. And yeah, I just feel this kind of panic constantly about people that I care about facing homelessness and this need. I feel like... Yeah, I just feel like I, when I have money, pretty much always just feel like I, into the community and I've been criticized for that, but I don't know what else I can do because I really feel that people will not be safe if we're not distributing the very limited resources that we do have.

        "words": "Going back to housing and stuff, I think it's very, very difficult for anyone disabled and just the society we live in now. We have to be compared with regular normal people. It makes it really, really difficult for us to thinking, is it just us or is it them? We talked about making a buck. Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \"Oh, I do Section 8.\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \"Oh, you don't look it,\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too. But it's difficult to survive on that when people had the mind frame of thinking that. Thank you.",

I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too.

It makes it really, really difficult for us to thinking, is it just us or is it them? We talked about making a buck. Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \"Oh, I do Section 8.\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \"Oh, you don't look it,\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too.

We have to be compared with regular normal people. It makes it really, really difficult for us to thinking, is it just us or is it them? We talked about making a buck. Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \\\"Oh, I do Section 8.\\\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \\\"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\\\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \\\"Oh, you don't look it,\\\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know...

It makes it really, really difficult for us to thinking, is it just us or is it them? We talked about making a buck. Unfortunately the world we live in, look at the future President Trump business, they trying make a buck. They don't really care about the individual in the longterm anymore. Seeing that, you said 10 years from now, maybe 20 years from now, maybe it's more like that. But as I said I was moved, I got kicked out because it was sold. I was living government housing, I thought was all set then got sold. And it's been about five years now and when I immediately got out of it, I had to reapply to all different places again so I'm back with regular people. Every single time we have to fill all those forms out again to update. It's the frustration of that. I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \"Oh, I do Section 8.\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \"Oh, you don't look it,\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Didn't have social life and social life was pretty much at work because I came with a lot of immigrants coming over. They struggled to survive. Our family didn't have any benefits. We didn't know... My parents didn't speak English and stuff, so I had to work from bottom up and continue doing that. It's a long haul. Hopefully things do change and take it year by year because that's what they say and that's all you can do. And I tell people that as well too. But it's difficult to survive on that when people had the mind frame of thinking that. Thank you.",

I think then definitely more housing and more to stick to the subjects, not combining the Section 8 too much with it, but keeping it how it was before, which is a disabled and elderly, it really makes a difference because I noticed I had applied to some Section 8 ones and they don't want people that are fixed income. They want people that are fluctuate, they want to make money out of it. Business again. I applied to five for a federal disabled and elderly. Then I did another five, six for Section 8 because my friend said, \\\"Oh, I do Section 8.\\\" There's plenty of where her neighborhood is. I did and I called back to respond. They said, \\\"Oh, we're going to put you on this thing,\\\" because of my age group and stuff and things. It's very frustrating that sense that I don't see this getting better, it's only getting worse because I hear about social security is going to be disappearing 15 years from now. Thinking back like my mom, she's from China, everyone been on their own basically. Really comes down, you're not saying they have to be on benefits forever, but that's how I grew up. Paying for my own education, eight years by myself. No loans, no debt to this day and stuff I still save crazy and stuff. I was work hard, I take 10 hours a day and stuff. Now I do a lot of volunteering a lot now on Zoom. I can't go out. I can't go out of my condition and stuff. I try still give back and I was probably doing it right beforehand. But the idea of that, it's just very frustrating as compared to normal people and the society we live in is not good. It's really more difficult for us to struggle with that. And you talk about healthcare. Gone through a lot and stuff, I'm actually paying for healthcare for my condition and it's unbelievable. I don't have Mass Health. I have to pay Mass Health for my insurance. I'm disabled. I mean the thought of that and it fluctuates because I worked so hard and stuff. And if I could go back 30 years when I'm in my 20s, I'm about 51 now. You would say, \\\"Oh, you don't look it,\\\" because I take care of myself. That if I go back in my 20s, I would not have gotten so much schooling and stuff, I would get better benefits. And now I'm struggling because the margin of how low income and poverty and stuff is fluctuate and that's how I struggled with that for payment wise, money wise and living situation. It's very, very frustrating and upsetting how someone that I didn't have a choice, was a genetic, later in life. I'm first diagnosed in my family and think lot of reasons because I also stressed and I was working 10, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.

I actually used to snow blow the entire one side of the street and my neighbor would snow blow the other side of the street. Now I can't do that and have to pay somebody to do it for me, but it's really an issue of we've made some improvements and I think the tea has gotten better, but the tea got better because they got sued and so they had to implement a program. It's like why does it have to come to that? And health insurance is a big issue. I mean I'm very fortunate that because I have a lot of medical issues that my wife is willing to stay legally married to me even though she's in a relationship with somebody else, but stay legally married to me so that I can have the health insurance. But it shouldn't be that way. Health insurance should be somewhat affordable and it's not at all. Even with the Connector that we have, I know a lot of people that get health insurance to the Connector and they have either really high deductibles or really high premiums if they have any kind of medical issue.

I don't know if you can see the chat, but one of the things I think of is way back when I moved to the city, Mayor Menino was the mayor and he had a really strong program for people who had, seniors or people who had disabilities, other people volunteering to do yard work and snow shoveling and that kind of stuff. And it kind of exists in name right now, but it doesn't actually really exist. And that's a big issue for a lot of people. That's a big issue for me. I mean, I used to be the one, my neighborhood, my side of the street had a lot of older people when I first moved here and I did not have a disability. I actually used to snow blow the entire one side of the street and my neighbor would snow blow the other side of the street. Now I can't do that and have to pay somebody to do it for me, but it's really an issue of we've made some improvements and I think the tea has gotten better, but the tea got better because they got sued and so they had to implement a program. It's like why does it have to come to that? And health insurance is a big issue. I mean I'm very fortunate that because I have a lot of medical issues that my wife is willing to stay legally married to me even though she's in a relationship with somebody else, but stay legally married to me so that I can have the health insurance. But it shouldn't be that way. Health insurance should be somewhat affordable and it's not at all.

I don't know if you can see the chat, but one of the things I think of is way back when I moved to the city, Mayor Menino was the mayor and he had a really strong program for people who had, seniors or people who had disabilities, other people volunteering to do yard work and snow shoveling and that kind of stuff. And it kind of exists in name right now, but it doesn't actually really exist. And that's a big issue for a lot of people. That's a big issue for me. I mean, I used to be the one, my neighborhood, my side of the street had a lot of older people when I first moved here and I did not have a disability. I actually used to snow blow the entire one side of the street and my neighbor would snow blow the other side of the street. Now I can't do that and have to pay somebody to do it for me, but it's really an issue of we've made some improvements and I think the tea has gotten better, but the tea got better because they got sued and so they had to implement a program. It's like why does it have to come to that? And health insurance is a big issue. I mean I'm very fortunate that because I have a lot of medical issues that my wife is willing to stay legally married to me even though she's in a relationship with somebody else, but stay legally married to me so that I can have the health insurance. But it shouldn't be that way. Health insurance should be somewhat affordable and it's not at all. Even with the Connector that we have, I know a lot of people that get health insurance to the Connector and they have either really high deductibles or really high premiums if they have any kind of medical issue.

I was telling a friend that is actually going through a job, he actually... There is a stigma regarding about mental health. I met him 30 years ago. He's around how old I am. And he had a meltdown, that's how we didn't work out for us. And he was working there and he actually lost a job, but he never had any issues later on and stuff. There is a stigma there, but now he's been looking for a job. There's a discrimination also with being older too.

I have few patients myself, I still see and do things. But yes, it's not the very friendly world we live in now. Everyone's just to themselves doing things. It's been more difficult with people that are disabled and stuff by the way of doing things or going through the process of it. I have a friend that is actually, she is in the process of trying find disability on herself and finding housing at the same time.

One thing, Whitney, I just want to say I did in a chat about the Cole Center. I don't know if you can see the chat, but one of the things I think of is way back when I moved to the city, Mayor Menino was the mayor and he had a really strong program for people who had, seniors or people who had disabilities, other people volunteering to do yard work and snow shoveling and that kind of stuff. And it kind of exists in name right now, but it doesn't actually really exist. And that's a big issue for a lot of people. That's a big issue for me. I mean, I used to be the one, my neighborhood, my side of the street had a lot of older people when I first moved here and I did not have a disability. I actually used to snow blow the entire one side of the street and my neighbor would snow blow the other side of the street. Now I can't do that and have to pay somebody to do it for me, but it's really an issue of we've made some improvements and I think the tea has gotten better, but the tea got better because they got sued and so they had to implement a program. It's like why does it have to come to that? And health insurance is a big issue. I mean I'm very fortunate that because I have a lot of medical issues that my wife is willing to stay legally married to me even though she's in a relationship with somebody else, but stay legally married to me so that I can have the health insurance. But it shouldn't be that way. Health insurance should be somewhat affordable and it's not at all. Even with the Connector that we have, I know a lot of people that get health insurance to the Connector and they have either really high deductibles or really high premiums if they have any kind of medical issue. And I'm in getting into the older section session of life so more issues tend to come with that sometimes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 107,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Caitlin\",\n    \"words\": \"And another issue with the Connector, I don't know about the state side, but when the federal went online, the more affordable plans were literally health insurance in name only.

It's the name and those schools are no different than any others. It's about what you put into it. The people that put into their life, that invest into their life and their own improving, self-improvement are the people who I think are working harder than any job that exists. And at the end of the day, people are just being rewarded for not giving anything to themselves and not giving anything to other people. And I just wanted to add that when I was in college, my parents were divorced and they were married in Massachusetts and they were in the courthouse downtown. And my dad was a little bit difficult.

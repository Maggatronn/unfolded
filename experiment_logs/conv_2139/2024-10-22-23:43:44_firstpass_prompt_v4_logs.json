Welcome to this conversation sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine on Cortico's Local Voices Network. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from all around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we lift up the voices and needs of a whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier public sphere, and education is a part of that. So we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection.

So I just have to read this beginning piece and then we'll get into the questions. Welcome to this conversation sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine on Cortico's Local Voices Network. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from all around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we lift up the voices and needs of a whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier public sphere, and education is a part of that. So we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. The data is owned by the Education Action Forum of Maine, and you will receive an email following the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED-250. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand, and agree to this, please say \\\"I agree.\\\" So we have your [inaudible] consent to use it.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 2,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Lauralie\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 3,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Rowan\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 4,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Edge\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 5,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Acadia\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 6,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Nick\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 7,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Linden\",\n    \"words\": \"I agree.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 8,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Speaker 1\",\n    \"words\": \"All right.

We have the money to make it really, really nice, but for some reason we do not prioritize the generations that are coming through, millions and millions of people per year, going through the school system. We have the money to pay teachers a fair living wage, and there's enough interest in it to do it so that we don't need shortages, so we don't have shortages or these education deserts where it's hard to get an education. When you're actually in the education system, we need to really help people understand what is important, less droning and on and on about how to... It's a tough question. The perfect school system is going to look a lot different for different people. I think there are things that we could do to fundamentally improve it. I think personally that we should spend more time educating on bias, I suppose. We have a lot of racial bias, a lot of sexual bias, a lot of identity bias just in general. We don't teach the important parts of our history, I'd say. We teach our weird whitewashed version of history that every kid gets when they go to school. It doesn't need to run your bank account into the ground when you go to get higher education and it doesn't need to be... What is it? Eight hours, nine hours a day, five days a week. That's too much. It's a tough question to tackle because there are a lot of aspects. I think it needs to be different. It's going to take a lot of people working very hard together for the betterment of people to make it more functional things."

Other free speaking, free idea groups really aren't all that. A lot of the time, somebody is in charge giving you the agenda and telling you what your focus is for this group. Even if it is supposed to be student oriented or student led, it's all under the same thumb of administration. If they don't want something to be talked about, then it won't be talked about. There is not a lot of voice for people who want to share their ideas. And then my own thought completely separate from that is, as I get back to the question, is everybody's different. I think when we're talk today about everybody having different ideas, even in this group, there's no be all, end all. Just taking the time to listen to people around you can do... Really listen and really implement afterwards can do so much.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_turn\": 100,\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Speaker 1\",\n    \"words\": \"Yeah.

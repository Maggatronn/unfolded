    "words": "Okay. All right. So I just have to read this beginning piece and then we'll get into the questions. Welcome to this conversation sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine on Cortico's Local Voices Network. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from all around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we lift up the voices and needs of a whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier public sphere, and education is a part of that. So we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. The data is owned by the Education Action Forum of Maine, and you will receive an email following the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine, and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED-250. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand, and agree to this, please say \"I agree.\" So we have your [inaudible] consent to use it.",

Share fully and leave time for everyone to participate. Listen openly and ask questions when you want to know more about something that you have heard. Remember that it is not a debate or about winning, or even about finding an agreement, it's just about sharing experiences and ideas and listening to others. We are going to use the circle process, so we're just going to go around this way so that everyone has a chance to speak. And you can always say pass or ask for us to come back to you. To begin, let's do a quick round of introductions, just a sentence or two. So please share your first name, the county and town you live in, and a specific example of a time you felt you mattered to your community. Start right with this side.",

A lot of the time, somebody is in charge giving you the agenda and telling you what your focus is for this group. Even if it is supposed to be student oriented or student led, it's all under the same thumb of administration. If they don't want something to be talked about, then it won't be talked about. There is not a lot of voice for people who want to share their ideas. And then my own thought completely separate from that is, as I get back to the question, is everybody's different. I think when we're talk today about everybody having different ideas, even in this group, there's no be all, end all. Just taking the time to listen to people around you can do...

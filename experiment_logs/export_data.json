        "transcript": "Okay. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network. Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine are the co-sponsors of Maine Education 2050, and we're grateful for your participation. There are three main purposes for the conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the directions of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth, and people in the major Maine industries. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier published sphere, and education is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. One that I think you all are used to having, actually, if you work through consensus. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the LVN collection, Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education ACTION Forum of Maine, and you'll receive an email following in the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available, but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. I will ask you to do that in a minute. As a participant in the conversation, you're providing consent to Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use this recording in accordance with the mission of Maine Education 2050. You also understand that the conversation will be a part of a collection at Cortico's Local Voices Network.

        "transcript": "Okay. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network. Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine are the co-sponsors of Maine Education 2050, and we're grateful for your participation. There are three main purposes for the conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the directions of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth, and people in the major Maine industries. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier published sphere, and education is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. One that I think you all are used to having, actually, if you work through consensus. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the LVN collection, Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education ACTION Forum of Maine, and you'll receive an email following in the conversation, giving you access to it as well.

When I was raising my children, I was very insular living out in China with Waterville being my service center. And then I gradually became involved in what was happening, and then as my empty nest happened the same year that REM was born, I was absolutely totally 100% involved in REM. And so as I watched it grow, it was a very, I don't know what the right word is, but the fences around the towns were up pretty high. Waterville did Waterville winds, Rome did Roman whenever the neighbors didn't speak much.

We thought we were just bringing community together to create a vision and some teams where they could work. And actually the vision was hugely powerful that more than one mayor in the next 25 years brought that vision out at their inaugurations because it talked about working together, collaborating, acting as a region, as a service center, as a people. Well, I would say most people would say 20, 25 mile radius around. That brought China and that brought lots of little towns in. And if you go... You're talking about a meeting, I once went to a meeting and walked in and one of the leaders of the community said, uh-oh Faye's here, now we're going to have to collaborate. And everybody laughed, but that's basically the most powerful thing that came out of that meeting was everybody was now, and I think enjoying the fact that they could and it was now okay and it was part of how we were to do things, to join hands and work together. Because there's nothing more exciting than being on a winning team and we all felt that that's what we were building. There was a real excitement about that. I think that was the biggest change I saw. And if you were in that community now, absolutely collaboration is the thing.

Now Colby has come off the hill in a way that nobody, not even Colby, believe me, especially not Colby at that time envisioned. That big change in a time of COVID is really a challenge for our community. I have every thought and every feeling in my heart that when that is all over and well and we're back to healthy again, it will be one of our greatest pride and joys, but change, even small changes for individuals are difficult. And this is such a huge change coming from, just imagine now difficult it is for Colby to be doing this and then having COVID hit right in the middle of all their investments and all their work.

        "transcript": "Well, I came here in 72 from Rockville, Maryland. This community was brand new to me. When I was raising my children, I was very insular living out in China with Waterville being my service center. And then I gradually became involved in what was happening, and then as my empty nest happened the same year that REM was born, I was absolutely totally 100% involved in REM. And so as I watched it grow, it was a very, I don't know what the right word is, but the fences around the towns were up pretty high. Waterville did Waterville winds, Rome did Roman whenever the neighbors didn't speak much. As part of the visioning that the people, about 250 people wrote over a three day community catalyst that REM brought to start and birth REM, which we didn't know we were doing at the time. We thought we were just bringing community together to create a vision and some teams where they could work. And actually the vision was hugely powerful that more than one mayor in the next 25 years brought that vision out at their inaugurations because it talked about working together, collaborating, acting as a region, as a service center, as a people. Well, I would say most people would say 20, 25 mile radius around. That brought China and that brought lots of little towns in. And if you go... You're talking about a meeting, I once went to a meeting and walked in and one of the leaders of the community said, uh-oh Faye's here, now we're going to have to collaborate. And everybody laughed, but that's basically the most powerful thing that came out of that meeting was everybody was now, and I think enjoying the fact that they could and it was now okay and it was part of how we were to do things, to join hands and work together. Because there's nothing more exciting than being on a winning team and we all felt that that's what we were building. There was a real excitement about that. I think that was the biggest change I saw. And if you were in that community now, absolutely collaboration is the thing. There are tests that we need to meet, COVID didn't help, COVID didn't help at all. Because now all of the individual pieces are being tested to their extremes. That makes it difficult for... One of the biggest things that the community voted for, and the votes was for a lay department store called Sterns. One of the biggest things, they were hoping that Colby would come off the hill, be more part of the community because everybody sensed a lot of the answers, knowledge, et cetera, exist there. Now Colby has come off the hill in a way that nobody, not even Colby, believe me, especially not Colby at that time envisioned. That big change in a time of COVID is really a challenge for our community. I have every thought and every feeling in my heart that when that is all over and well and we're back to healthy again, it will be one of our greatest pride and joys, but change, even small changes for individuals are difficult. And this is such a huge change coming from, just imagine now difficult it is for Colby to be doing this and then having COVID hit right in the middle of all their investments and all their work. And instead of having a hotel, you have to put kids up in your hotel. For everybody, it's really hard, and I'm just praying that when it dies down, it'll be peace in the valley.",

I met Faye and got involved with REM and that was about it. Boy, everything from there, that touches everything, so many different organizations. And I got involved with a lot of different nonprofits around helping all those, too. That was a busy part. I have found it a very interesting place, there's lots to do here, you can get involved with it. If you just try, you can find things to get involved with. And I've got involved with different ones, my church is involved in an essentials closet they've started up recently where they hand out items to people and that's just a wonderful thing that's there and it's a needed thing. That's there and it's a needed thing. It's wonderful. These kinds of things that people in the area say, Hey, we need this and someone does it. It's very nice. I'm tempted to say that this is the way life should be right here in Maine and I'm quite happy with it. Seeing all the involvement with the colleges in the town, I think that's the good thing. I love to see bringing the students in working with this, I'd like to see more of that. That's great. That's about all.",

I don't know how many people would even know because I still get people who are like, you've been here 20 years, where have I been? I think one of our biggest things is we get so lost in feeding people and creating safe places for women who've been hurt. And for having REM robotics teams out competing, all these things take your focus, but if you don't take the time to let people know you're even there, you're hurting your people instead of helping them. I think we need to use the multitude of media that we have and take time to develop that communication so that people know. And so that they have a good way to connect so that it's clear. We are in our fundraising time right now, and we'll probably do a pretty sloppy job of it because we'll be out doing other things, but we need to stop and we need to really look. And you're talking about a diversity of people. I can remember working days on a leaflet and handing it to someone, and she sat there and read it, wanted to please me and do what I asked for. And she looked at me and put it on the table and said, I can honestly say, I do not know one thing that was written in this. Understand that we talk about the diversity and then we use a word like consensus building. How do you, and this gets to my second most important part that I've learned in this time. Many times we take something like people who need food and we decide, we, the eaters, we, the growers, we, the producers say, okay, this is how we're going to get those people food. Where are the people who need the food in that decision or setting up that process? I learned that from Women, Work, and Community many, many years ago right at the beginning where I know I'm like, oh, I'm at the middle of this. I don't know anything, what am I going to do? And I went to Susan [Aline], who has since passed, at Women, Work, and Community and started to learn.

I don't know how many people would even know because I still get people who are like, you've been here 20 years, where have I been? I think one of our biggest things is we get so lost in feeding people and creating safe places for women who've been hurt. And for having REM robotics teams out competing, all these things take your focus, but if you don't take the time to let people know you're even there, you're hurting your people instead of helping them. I think we need to use the multitude of media that we have and take time to develop that communication so that people know. And so that they have a good way to connect so that it's clear. We are in our fundraising time right now, and we'll probably do a pretty sloppy job of it because we'll be out doing other things, but we need to stop and we need to really look. And you're talking about a diversity of people. I can remember working days on a leaflet and handing it to someone, and she sat there and read it, wanted to please me and do what I asked for. And she looked at me and put it on the table and said, I can honestly say, I do not know one thing that was written in this. Understand that we talk about the diversity and then we use a word like consensus building. How do you, and this gets to my second most important part that I've learned in this time. Many times we take something like people who need food and we decide, we, the eaters, we, the growers, we, the producers say, okay, this is how we're going to get those people food. Where are the people who need the food in that decision or setting up that process? I learned that from Women, Work, and Community many, many years ago right at the beginning where I know I'm like, oh, I'm at the middle of this. I don't know anything, what am I going to do? And I went to Susan [Aline], who has since passed, at Women, Work, and Community and started to learn. And that was one of their biggest lessons was that the people who were involved in the problem need to be involved in this solution. Otherwise, you're going to be less than you could be. That would be my thing to make sure that everybody who is involved is in part of the solution.",

There's one girl who wasn't even going to go to college or anything that this woman saw in her when she was doing a mock trial for fun, that this girl really has a mind and she's really smart. She goes out of her way to convince the parents that this young woman could be an excellent attorney. And of course in the story it works out that way in the end. I know it doesn't always, but part of the community vision says that we are all family. And I think that that's a really important place. If you're all family and a family your next door neighbor is having trouble because drugs or whatever, right.

And I've always had a secret, I don't know how secret it would be. I don't have any secrets from Jackie, so probably can't call it a secret, but I think that the work that's being done at Educare benefits a group of kids, a group of people, but because of the world that we know now and the capacities we have for social media communication, I think we're not doing nearly enough. And I think it would take the community coming in and giving the time. I've always wanted REM to work and I've talked with Educare about it and they were more than open to it, but finding the energy and the thing to make that link between all parents, not just the ones lucky enough to be working every day with Educare. But take a camera in with a teacher who has a really neat lesson for the day and just sit there and tape it and then put it on the REM library. And name it so that when your child's having trouble with X, getting along in the sandbox, you could just watch that and take that into your own parents library and have that for yourself. That would be my dream to link. When I taught special ed, they gave an award, you got ice cream to the whole glass who had the biggest, I always had 100% because I get we and got them. I got the mother who was the bartender, I got them, and I had 100% every time. I think anybody and that class could have helped make that happen. My classes were 10 kids, so no problem, but getting the families and the parents to be more of the process so that we link it. You can talk generally so you don't have to identify your child, you can say, what if a child is having this? And then the parents can all talk about ways that they've gotten around that because there isn't anything that happens to one that hasn't happened to all the others as well. Somehow linking of in conversation. Doing what we're doing here today, just think of how beautiful this is and that we can do this. And 20 years ago we were going what? Not even imagining it. I think we need to use our tools and think about them and no matter how poor somebody is, their kids will have phones or texting or whatever. And if not, fix that.

And I've always had a secret, I don't know how secret it would be. I don't have any secrets from Jackie, so probably can't call it a secret, but I think that the work that's being done at Educare benefits a group of kids, a group of people, but because of the world that we know now and the capacities we have for social media communication, I think we're not doing nearly enough. And I think it would take the community coming in and giving the time. I've always wanted REM to work and I've talked with Educare about it and they were more than open to it, but finding the energy and the thing to make that link between all parents, not just the ones lucky enough to be working every day with Educare. But take a camera in with a teacher who has a really neat lesson for the day and just sit there and tape it and then put it on the REM library. And name it so that when your child's having trouble with X, getting along in the sandbox, you could just watch that and take that into your own parents library and have that for yourself. That would be my dream to link. When I taught special ed, they gave an award, you got ice cream to the whole glass who had the biggest, I always had 100% because I get we and got them. I got the mother who was the bartender, I got them, and I had 100% every time. I think anybody and that class could have helped make that happen. My classes were 10 kids, so no problem, but getting the families and the parents to be more of the process so that we link it. You can talk generally so you don't have to identify your child, you can say, what if a child is having this? And then the parents can all talk about ways that they've gotten around that because there isn't anything that happens to one that hasn't happened to all the others as well.

And I remember there was one of the people in REM from the very beginning, he had two children and he never showed up at a REM discussion without those kids.

They're not even in interested in the sandbox. I guess my main thing would be that they came through, people could though have an average six to eight careers in their lifetime so that they might go back to school, I have friends who go back to school at age 80 because they want to do something right. I think that's very important that we look at it as this is a place where you learn to be a human. Kids come home from school, say what happened today? And the things that they don't tell you have nothing to do with any of the five subjects they had. They had things that happened to them, people who said things, people were doing things, that's really what their learning and what they're churning in their heads. It's that process where we learn to go with this particular mass of people to become a person and the experience you have there. Just making that environment as challenging and exciting and demanding and all those things as possible. I would say that my feeling is not you go there to get a job, that's just a little teeny piece of it because that's going to work out on the other end, forced by the fact that you just put a diamond ring on somebody's finger. And so you got to be thinking and hopefully the school made it so that it's not a last minute decision that you've made progress and everybody made sure you were making progress and supported you in every way they could, but I thought about something I wanted to add here. We've talked about the little kids in the sandbox, and a lot of this, to me, is about 50 years from now. And so I'm thinking I'm 76, I got four more really productive years according to the stats, and I'm thinking how important it is to get the young kids and the older kids together. We're going to be starting a lifelong learning center. We had this thing we call a chat, so the civic engagement go far civic engagement piece under the leadership of Elizabeth [Surname] sort of took the chat, which was it an hour and a half hour? Hour, Jackie? And you chat on something, one girl chatted on her vases, that she studied vases. Another person did it on writing pen pals with one of the nursing homes. They just took them and ran with them. Now, we're sitting here looking at these faces. There was this young face of a girl talking about the importance of restorative justice with about 10 or 15 people, 65 and older, and how close they were and how they loved conversing and learning from each other. The one who did the restorative justice piece ended up on our board where she's now in college. I'm sorry about my phone, it's rude. And she's down in Cambridge and she's on our board for REM. I'm just saying we have every way in the world now to put those groups together. We should just be doing it in every way we think possible so that there's so much to learn from the kids who are in the sandbox. And there's so much to go where in the other way, for us to share with them. Or the sandbox is still Colby college students, to me. When you're 76, they're in the sandbox.",

On lvn.org, you can search conversation, listen to audio snippets of other conversations, discover patterns across conversations. You'll receive an invitation from us to join the platform and explore these conversations. And also with this conversation, you'll be able to go in and really hear or read it and go into the parts where you spoke and highlight, literally with a highlighter tool, highlight what you feel are the very most important parts that you want people to be able to find very easily. People across me will have access to all of the things you said, but these highlights kind of rise to the talk. They're kind of the headlines. You'll have a chance to do that and we'll be able to help you figure out how to do all of that once the conversations are uploaded. It takes a couple weeks, so not tomorrow. All right. I am going to stop recording.",

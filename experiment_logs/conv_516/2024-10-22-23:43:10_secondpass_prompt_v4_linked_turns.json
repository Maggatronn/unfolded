Adhere to these rules or else more people are going to die.\" I tell my kids and my family, that's why I wake up and go into public education everyday, because we have not taught people how to really be educated and how to listen to the news everyday, and how to find out what's going on in the world around you. Since people can curate what they listen to and what they view, I know grown people that don't look at the news everyday. They don't know what's going on. They don't know that 783 people died yesterday, or we got 1000 new more cases. So if you're living in this bubble, which a lot of our young people are, at least the ones I experience, because school is not working for them, or life isn't working for them, so they create their own bubble. They're just like pigs to slaughter. They don't really get that they are endangering themselves or endangering their families, so it's really sad to see that we've got generations of undereducated people, basically.

    "words": "Well, my background actually is in finance, but I have been educating people in different arenas for a very long time. Due to a need for my children, I came to start working in the school system as what they call a community organizer and working with parents, and helping parents to understand how important it was to be a part of their child's education. But it happened, really, because I had a child that went into the public school system with an IEP, and I noticed the inequities that were happening. There was nobody there to really support me, and they kept telling me all these different things, that they wanted to put my child on medication and everything. It wasn't working for me, I was like, there's got to be another way, other than to have a child constantly on medication and walking through life looking, in my opinion, looking like a zombie. I became very interested in advocating for parents who didn't know any better, and that's what I do now. I actually advocate with parents and help parents to go in and help teachers. But the real thing that helped me and my moment that made me know that I made a difference is when I started doing this work, I went on the other side of the door, because I can tell you what happens as a parent when I'm outside of the school. I had no idea what was on when I walked in the inside, and I saw how the teachers are having to go through different things and not having the support, 30 kids in a classroom, one teacher, no other support, and five of them have an IEP, or 10 of them have an IEP, and she's expected to monitor these children as well as teach the other 20. It's not happening. And if it is happening, it's not happening in an efficient manner. What I do is I help parents to go into the classroom to support the teacher, and one parent came to me, who had two children that had an IEP, and she thanked me, and she said, \"You don't know, I didn't understand, before I came here. You don't know what a difference it makes for me to actually understand how important it is for me to be in here with this teacher and to help this teacher and to help this teacher with, even the other children,\" because once my parents go into the classrooms, they tend to have a whole different aspect of what the school system is really about, and they fall in love with the kids, and the kids, again, enrich them. They come back and they say, \"Thank you for giving me this opportunity. You made a difference. Thank you for letting me understand what really goes on,\" because we have a lot of parents that will complain on the outside of the school door, but they never bother to get involved. They never bother to see what's really happening. They never bother to see is it that the teacher just really doesn't want to get back to me, or the fact that she is so overwhelmed she can't. That's happening in our schools, in our community, but if you go up north, there's all kinds of teachers' aides, and there's such an inequity. I see parents that are leaving CPS and going out to different suburban schools, because they just want to give their child a better opportunity. I'm going to be honest with you, I was one of them.

Parents aren't really encouraged to be involved either, and it's not made convenient for parents either, especially if you work two jobs, you work shift work. That's a whole, well, thank you for the work that you're doing with parents, because they need you. I guess my story is, I don't know, sometimes I wake up and think I'm not making a difference most mornings. There's been a couple times where, and the one that I'll share is one of my last public school positions, I have worked for CPS. I still work in CPS now, as a community partner, but I was up at Evanston Township High School, where I was for about six years, and I was a district-wide administrator. I was their first literacy coordinator, so it was about how do you get reading achievement up on a high school level? I was brought in to solve that big huge problem, and it was tough. But the one thing I will say that I was able to do was get every teacher and every department to know that they had to give kids reading strategies in order to, what am I trying to say? Deal with the content. To access the content. Because if you can't read, it doesn't matter what it says in your science book, because you can't read. You might know how a cell works in your head, but if you can't read it, you can't take the test. If you can't take the test, you know the story. I was able to do that, so integrate reading strategies in every content area, and we detracked humanities, which is English, social studies, and then, eventually, freshman biology. If you know how tracking works, kids take a test, and they get placed in a certain class based on that score, and they're in that track that whole four years. You can't get out of it, no matter if you got straight As the whole time you were there. If you get placed in a lower level class, you can never take an honors class, you can never take an AP class, because you're in that track. What we did was we got rid of tracking for those subjects for freshmen, so that, when they were initially placed, if they were able to achieve, then they were able to move up by just merit alone, and they were able to access honors classes and AP classes, and I was very happy about that, because you don't get into the good universities unless you have honors or AP, period. I found that out with my own kids. When we were going to school, it was like, have a good admissions essay, have some decent grades, and get a decent ACT score, right? But now you can have pretty much a top ACT or SAT, you can have a great essay, but if you do not have honors or AP, they don't consider it a college prep curriculum, and you do not have access to those top tier schools. That's the new gatekeeper, it's the AP and honors. Tell your parents that. When they go to high school, make sure they have honors or AP, it doesn't matter. My kid went to St. Rita, and he took three years of science, three years of math, two years of Latin. You know what I mean, I'm like, okay. And he got turned down by DePaul, Loyola, and it was another one, exactly. I'm just like, \"Wait a second. What is happening?\" But one guy at DePaul finally told me, and I was frustrated, as a parent, my kid is crying every night because he can't get into a college, that that was a new gate. Nobody informed me, but he said, \"You don't have an AP or an honors, and that's what they look at now.\" So who tells the parents, right?",

All right, let's move on to COVID-19. We want to move on to the conversations about your hopes and concerns about COVID-19 in your community. We know this is a depressing issue before us as a nation, and we are already gearing up for two other events of huge consequence for us in 2020, before this hit, the election and the census. We're here today in light of COVID to reflect on what matters most as it will be reflected in the census and the election. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but I hope this will be a time for some back and forth among us as we share our stories. For the next part of the conversation, we'll move from the format of taking turns speaking to a more natural back and forth conversation. I think we're pretty much there. I'd invite you to respond to the points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So, first question: what strength has COVID-19 revealed or uncovered about your community or neighborhood? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better.

I speak to the gentleman all the time, we wave or whatever, but he was like, \"Hey, look, I just want to share this with you, because I know you have kids.\" He didn't see me leaving out to go to work anymore.

And we were doing work in Englewood, I was working with some schools, and he actually was working with Englewood, because his job was to go out and tell people in the community of all these grant programs and resources that the state of Illinois offers that people didn't know about. One of his key projects was emergency preparedness, and I remember him giving presentations to people about we are so vulnerable, we don't even know it. If our power grid got taken out, we would be literally in survival mode. There would be no cell phones, there would be no refrigeration for food. There would be no computers, there would be no getting money out of the bank. There would be nothing, so you have to prepare. He would help people figure out how do I prepare for an emergency? I remember people would say, \"Wow, that's really interesting,\" but nobody ever took it seriously. It was kind of like he was \"womp womp womp,\" and people didn't take it seriously. But he kind of planted the seed in me, and now, as I look back 15 years later, I'm like, \"Man, you were warning people. You were warning people that things like this could happen.\" We're not ready, and being prepared for an emergency is a privilege. Like you said, not a lot of us have money to go out to [inaudible] and buy freezers or build bunkers or panic rooms or have all this food stored up. It's really a privilege to be prepared for an emergency. That's a whole 'nother question, how do we get our neighbors prepared? Because this is not the last emergency that's going to happen. Matter of fact, they might start happening closer and closer. So that was something that I kind of thought of. Whose right is it to survive an emergency situation?

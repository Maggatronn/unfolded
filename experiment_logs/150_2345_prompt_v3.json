Let me continue here, we're almost 2.5 years into the pandemic and the struggle around accurate, reliable, and trusted information sources is still real. You may often find yourself being pulled into different directions, feeling confused or in doubt when trying to evaluate which information to trust or make decisions that concern your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of the people you care about in your family and your community. The initiative you're joining today aims to change that. This conversation is part of an ongoing culminating power initiative called The Public Health Corps, a city-wide effort with a mission to expand the public health workforce by partnering with community groups and community health workers to eliminate COVID-19 inequities through outreach and education. The stories and experiences you share will become a part of the city-wide story library that amplifies the experiences of community members navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We are recording the audio of today's conversation and the video portion of the conversation will be immediately discarded. To protect your confidentiality, we ask that you share only your first name and your voice. If you have additional privacy concerns, you have the option to remain anonymous by using a pseudonym. If you'd like to use a pseudonym or alias, please change your Zoom name to your desire, and this is only for the people on Zoom, and we're doing Zoom today. We encourage you to share your stories and experiences openly and to respond to all the questions, but keep in mind that you may choose not to answer a question at any time, that's if you don't feel like you are comfortable answering. Before we begin, I'm going to read a consent statement and ask you ... And you already signed, so we don't have to read the consent statement, because you already did this in-person. Okay? So the recording is on and we going to ask the participant. As a participant in this conversation you are providing consent to the New York City Public Health Corps to use the recording. This is what you'll find, okay? First question. If you understand and agree to this ... No, I'm sorry. I have to move on, this is just for the people who are on Zoom. First question, and please feel free, if you don't feel comfortable, remember, you do not have to answer, but we'd love you to share whatever information you can, and as open as possible. Okay? What COVID-19 resources have been most helpful for you during the pandemic, and why? Go ahead, Nan.",

They were [inaudible] giving emotional and mental support and mental health, they were providing masks and sanitizer. At the time, we couldn't even find it on Amazon or anything, so this really made a difference because it was a time when we were so scared even to go out. I remember I was a scared even to talk to anybody. So even going to the supermarket across the street, I remember I spent about four weeks at home, I will never leave the house. So it made a difference for me, all those people who were providing services and bringing cooked food, and bringing these boxes of produce and sanitizers. So this was the initial impression of the role of not-for-profit organization during that time. Project Hospitality, they were delivery food pantries. They were available all the time and they were sending boxes to everybody at home. So I had the social worker calling me twice from Project Hospitality, a week, just for mental support, because I remember I was so scared. That every time we talked of our families it was like saying goodbye because we did not know if we are going to make it or not.",

I've been working since I was 13, I'm in my 60s. Love my job, but they shut us down so fast. It was dentistry, and I'm the manager, and it was rough because I had to tell staff that this is what's going on. The thing that was so weird was that the building that we worked in, we also shared a space with a oral surgeon. So in the beginning of this all, because patients were calling, we were shut down. They said, \"You cannot see any patients,\" the only thing we could do was call in prescriptions, as long as they were one of our patients so that we would know what they were not allergic to, and so on, and so on. It was difficult because there were people panicking, but they were calling doctors, but they were calling us thinking that they could come in. We were like, \"I'm sorry ...\" We had to stop answering the phone, and we would just check the messages. Every day there would be 30 or 40 messages, and it was people in emergency situations and they told us, \"Do not send them to the hospitals.\" So the oral surgeon, because again, we shared this with other dentists, he was allowed to be open, but the thing was is he was sending patients to us and we were like, \"We're closed.\" We went in every week for three days a week, to check. We had messages up to the hundreds. There was nothing we could do. We couldn't call in prescriptions because it could be someone wanting pills that ... That was illegal. We couldn't do it. So it was hard. It was hard, but when things finally got better and we had patients, you know ... But they shut us down so fast it wasn't funny. But all we could do was go in part time, check the messages, and they were always, \"I'm in pain.\" \"I'm in pain.\" But you have to be careful because it could've been somebody who just was on pills not for pain but for fun. So, anybody that we said had to do this and this, anybody that said, \"Oh, oh okay, that's all right,\" they would hang up, we knew that that's what they were ... They were addicts looking for pain medication. But it was weird. I have been in that business over 30-something years and it was hard because I've been a patient myself in dentistry, so to speak, before it got very different, like it is now. I mean, I was telling people I've had fillings done with no anesthetic. They were like ... I said, \"Yes. They didn't do it like that back in the day.\" I'm in my 60s, so you know? But it always made the patients feel better because I was good with that, but at the same time, I miss the patients. Met a lot of seniors that didn't come back and we were like, \"Oh, I hope they're still with us.\" Because they're family, and I was with this doctor 30-something years and if wasn't there they'd go, \"Where's Georgina?\" \"Where's Georgina?\" You know, \"She's out to lunch,\" or something. But we lost a few people, quite a few people. And then, when it was-",

Your parents had it, and everything. The fact is, is the kind of thing is, the warnings were out many years back, so to speak. Now, again, it seems like this is happening again. I guess it comes through every so many years, or whatever. I don't know if it's a warning. I kind of get that feeling, and I'm like, \"I'm not going to do that. No, I don't believe in that.\" But you could be a carrier and giving this to other people that haven't had it, maybe not just yet, but you know what I'm saying? That's the thing, and I don't think that they realize it. You could be a carrier and not even have the symptoms, or as bad, but you could be around people that get it and die, and that's because you had it and decided not to. That's your choice, of course, but to me, then you should stay home. Or just, basically, stay away from other people, because it's not fair-",

It was about 25 minutes, by car, to go. So the guy, the Access-A-Ride driver, they supposed to drop you off and leave you. I said to him, \"This is a deserted area, I don't know anybody here, and look, there is nobody in the street.\" He was so kind, he won't even leave me until I heard from them. I said, \"I don't know where to go.\" It was his lunch break. Can you imagine? And he took me there, 25 minutes, 27 minutes I still remember, and he dropped me where I'm supposed to go. Then I had to call Access-A-Ride and they said to me, \"Oh, we're sorry, we cannot.\" Because you know Access-A-Ride, they are very particular about location, and I don't know whatnot. Honestly, I don't know what happened then, it was like a miracle. I said, \"I need to talk to the supervisor,\" and I told her, \"This is what happened, what do you want me to do?

    "words": "Okay. Now, I'll start facilitating an intentional type of conversation, so I'm sharing personal stories and experiences rather than positions on issues. The MIT group designing this conversation is finding that this approach helps build connections and deepen mutual understanding. Before we begin, let's review some conversation agreements, including some baseline agreements. We're not on Zoom today, so I'll just say them out loud. If you disagree or you want to add anything to these conversation agreements, let me know. Speak for yourself and on your own experience. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Take turns and allow others to finish speaking. Stay curious. Ask honest questions. Pause. Take time for reflection. Listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Show that you're listening actively. Head nods, eye contact, and reactions in the chat help show people you are paying close attention to them. Close distractions on your laptop or phone to pay attention to each other as much as possible. Is everyone on board with these guidelines?",

Pass the phone around to speak into the mic and it should be a free flowing conversation. What are your first thoughts after watching the video? More specifically, can anyone relate to anything in the documentary personally? It doesn't have to be about airlines or Boeing, not specifically, but maybe mirrors the emotional and interpersonal issues that people are facing in the clip. I think this question is less about the documentary and its details and more about the documentary and its emotional appeal. I'll give you guys 10, 20 seconds to think about that one.",

That personally affected them as he was one of their very close friends. That affected them on a very deep level, but it also created a sense of fear, which was difficult for them to talk about to me directly. One, because it hurt them to talk about losing their friend, but also because they don't want to take away from something from me, but they also want to protect me, and I think looking about that situation, it can be seen as one in a million or one in a hundred thousand of situations that occur like that, but the fact is that there is still that risk and that's just a difficult thing to talk about, and especially once it's related to someone and it can be a difficult thing for you to warn someone about even when it's not that common.",

Did they even address this to their employees? Did they instate active plans for them to do something differently next time? I think that's something important for them to look at and to think about how they can treat their employees better, but on the other hand, how they can also prepare the flight attendants as well, and I think that just talks a lot about companies in general, how they need to respond to change in difficult situations when they're faced with these challenges and how they have to be better. I think their CEO was talking about that, who took full responsibility and said he came out and he was like, \"It's completely our fault.

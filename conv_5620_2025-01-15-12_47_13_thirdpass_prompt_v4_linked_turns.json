But the CEO's response in the video was kind of interesting because he said, \"We own it,\" and I guess that's the only clip that we got to hear. That was the only statement I heard.

This is $700, this is $600, this is this time, right? So it's also kind of hard, I think, when you want to have a conversation about Boeing because, aside from, oh, it's scary that they have no safety regulations, consumers kind of also don't feel a sense of ownership over this direct choice that they're making, because they don't really have a choice. It's not like, I'm going to boycott Starbucks because I don't feel like I want to support that message. It's not like I can say, okay, I'm not going to fly on Boeing planes anymore, because that's just not possible. And so even like, Ritika, if you're flying next week, unfortunately, you're probably flying on a Boeing plane. I don't know. That's why I feel like it's a little bit hard to kind of think about corporate accountability, because yeah, it pisses me off that there's safety regulations, but what can I do?",

That was really interesting and I didn't know that, because it seems like such a simple oversight.

And understanding, as Martin mentioned, and as we all saw, he was like, we own it, but what measures did he take? Because saying that a company owns something, in comparison to the personal CEO, I'm pretty sure he was also with the DOJ. There was an article and they were asking him about how much he gets paid. They were questioning that, in correlation with how Boeing is doing, you're getting paid way too much. And that was kind of just a lot of words that didn't go together that well. But in conclusion, I wish I would've kind of known more about how he personally, if he made any changes to how he's managing, because I'm pretty sure issues like this started happening directly after he took place, because as the John Oliver episode mentioned that Boeing used to have a huge culture of accountability.

And I think, another part of that too, and why there's not necessarily more to disagree on, is because, there wasn't necessarily elements in the video that were spoken about for a long time that are supposed to pull the heartstrings like last week when they had the specific interview from people it impacted. So if we could have gotten an interview with, instead of just professionals, someone who was on the flight, on any of the flights that they talk about, or an interview with someone who knew the whistleblower who passed away.

It was like, oh, before 1997 we used to do it like this, and then afterwards it was like this. Or something really basic like that, because they mentioned company culture, and we have nothing other than they don't seem to check things. I think, the company, Boeing would never describe their culture as, oh yeah, we just don't check things and stuff. If you had the perspective of someone on the ground, so to speak, something like that, they could say that, oh, hey, suddenly, all the higher ups told us that this wasn't worth checking, or something like that. I don't know what they would say, because I haven't seen the interview, because they didn't do it. But it would be very interesting if that was the case, because that seems like exactly what this sort of format is for, and actually talking to people who are involved, not just on the plane, but also at the site of the problem. Also, I think the other thing is, the good thing about the last video was that, it was very like, this is just because of how the nature of any sort of discourse about AIs is. It's always like, oh, in the future, it's going to be like this. And so all the interviews, I'm like, oh, maybe other than that one guy, the truck driver, they're like, oh, in the future, when AI comes, I don't think it'll be able to do this, I think it'll be able to do. That's interesting, because then at least you have some amount of... You have facts, but there's also amount of speculation and you have to think about different things, whereas this was pretty much all about the past. Everything that's happened now has happened. There isn't really any sort of future outlook, about anything, about Boeing or about consumers' choices, or about safety or really any sort of... We've been trying. I think I've noticed a lot of us have been trying to connect that to something, and it's kind of hard when you have nothing to go off of.",

And it started with them talking about how they figured out the problem because, I mean, this is aimed at pilots and stuff like that. It was like, hey, we noticed that the takeoff was fine, and then suddenly, the nose wanted to keep going down after. And like, oh, we just realized, oh, shoot, it was the trim and all that. But then, they also had an interview with the mechanic, the one who actually messed it up. And he said that, \"Yeah, I've done this a thousand times. I've heard of this happening, but I always thought that I would just do it right. I didn't believe them at first when they said that, oh, the trim was messed up. But then we went in and we looked at it, and yeah, they got swapped.\" To be honest, even that was pretty dry and just recollecting the facts, but at least having the perspective and having the story of like, oh, we tried doing this, but that didn't fix What did they do?

Okay, I recently bought a concert ticket, and they said something like, if you pay $200 or something, your ticket will be extra insured.

I'm not sure what Boeing is planning on actually doing, or how airlines, well, not airlines... No, yeah, actually airlines, how they're planning on reacting to the situation.

I was going to say, I mean, specifically about the concert insurance part, it's really interesting the way that works, and I am curious if, I mean, it's a little hard for airplanes to be like, we're going to have airplane insurance. But I think on a larger level about consumer services and things, it's applicable. Because the way concert insurance actually works is, let's say Ticketmaster sells you a ticket. Concert insurance is an extra 20 bucks or however much you said, but it's actually facilitated by a different company. So that different company is basically saying, if we collect enough 20 bucks from people and then you can't go because you have to be in the hospital or like, oh, you forgot a friend's birthday party, we'll refund your ticket. But Ticketmaster is not entitled or is not... You're not entitled to get a refund from them, you can only have ticket insurance. But then if you read the ticket insurance, it also says something like, oh, but if their concert's canceled, we're not going to pay you back, or things like that. So there's niches and little loopholes there. So I think, bringing it back to corporate accountability, it's interesting because you see that a lot of different corporations, I mean obviously their goal is to make profit, but there's also a difference between being... I mean, it's early, so I'm just going to say, there's a difference between being shitty and being a reasonable corporation. I think that's an oxymoron at this point. But the hope is that, that's not an oxymoron, and we kind of learn how to have good business practices. But when I'm watching this thing about Boeing and like, yes, it is a little dry and it's kind of straightforward and informative, but I'm also learning, oh, the door flew off because they didn't screw in bolts, and because no one knew they didn't screw in bolts. I'm like, damn, that's not cool. We are really, really screwed, I think, if this is the level at which our corporations don't have accountability because they don't care about the consumer, they care about the profit.

I look things up as they're happening because I like to learn more about it. And it also said that his predecessor was fired because of what happened to Ethiopia and Indonesia. Those planes crashed. He was fired. And then Calhoun is brought in as a CEO. And then they asked him to make a public comment on it, and he was like, \"Yeah, this was an issue. It was probably our fault for expecting the pilots to be able to fix it. But also, pilots in Ethiopia and Indonesia aren't as experienced as US pilots.\" Then someone asked him, \"Do you think this would've happened if the pilots were American?\" And he was like, \"No.\" And I was like, what's going on? Again, this idea that corporations are basically scapegoating their way out of these things. \"Yeah, it's our fault. We'll own it, but we're not owning it.\" That is so concerning, especially when you consider regulations are written in blood.

This video, the Frontline video, they wanted to be very dramatic out of the gate, like, oh, it was like this. I didn't know what's going on. They have all the cell phone footage and all that. Yeah, that's interesting. I find it interesting, at least in my experience of watching John Oliver, is that he starts this video by saying, okay, so we're going to talk about this now, and it's the least interesting way to start a video. But obviously, I think the reason why we keep watching that is just because it's always something going... It's we kind of have that level of trust that, sure, whatever he is going to say is going to be important, so it's worth sticking around. Whereas I think with something like this, you have to earn that trust. Maybe if I hadn't really thought about Frontline before, if the two videos we had watched that were actually really interesting and they were full of insightful and will and deep dives and all that, I would've started having that amount of trust for Frontline, and then maybe the next time I see something like that on YouTube or whatever, I would've sticked around longer.

And what I noticed about this documentary was that, I think, maybe because it's primarily based off of a certain expert they hire for the specific video, it's a different person.

And I mentioned earlier, video essays are similar in that sense that it's one person almost always, and you get familiar with their voice, and that gives you a sort of... When you have that relationship, you have a level of trust also. Peer-reviews videos were good, and also just the fact that it's a person. I saw this interesting discussion about it in that, we talk about clickbait on YouTube and all that. A lot of video essays have reverse clickbait, where the title is something kind of nondescript, and it's a fairly simple question that's answered fairly early. But then after that, or in the process of answering the question, it's actually much more interesting. And there's all sorts of other connections that you would've never known if you had just looked at the title or the thumbnail. Right, yeah, everyone talks about that, but it's like, that's the whole genre and people like that because, A, they like having actual deep, deep, I mean, that's such an overused word, but deep level of insight, and also having a voice that you can trust and that you can relate to. And I'm just going to say, from what I've been seeing, I don't think they have any of that. I think that's a very good question.

It's a company that makes documentaries and they have a pretty long-standing season format or whatever, so they have a brand. They have a brand identity, and I'm not sure if they're testing out a new spinoff show or something like that. But I think what Zahed was saying is, you're watching these videos and if you can't tell they're made by the same person, or you couldn't tell who it was made by, you could say it was made by this guy or this guy or this guy, I think that's important because you build that trust when have that brand identity. Just really weird. That sounds like I'm a marketing major who's just trying to say, trust me, I promise, but there is some truth in it, right? I'm going to click a video from the same guy, versus I'm not really sure... Or someone I've watched before and I know their style and I trust, versus I'm not really sure if it's just kind of bland. And so obviously, when you watch something new, you're trying it out. But I think making sure, from last week, and then we can also see this again maybe next week and the week after, unless there's a consistent style across the documentaries, I think you kind of lose a little bit of trust in your audience because there's not... I think personality is a little bit more important in documentaries and making sure that people want to stick and want to stay through. So whether that's having a consistent narrator through them or bringing in more empathy into the storytelling, like Brianna was talking about, any of those things can work. I think it's kind of trial and error, but that's what sticks out to me also.",

If you can tell a human story about the incident, then that's a leg up over the Wikipedia article for Alaska Airlines incident. I think another example is that of something I just was notified to. Someone sent me this video, from the US Chemical Safety Board, and it was similar in a sense that it's an incident that was caused by a lack of regulation or whatever, but because these are the people investigating it, it was actually a very comprehensive engineering level breakdowns. And also, the incident in question, I think it was a bunch of acids spilled out on some workers because they accidentally unscrewed... They were trying to replace a pump and they accidentally unscrewed the cap to one of the tubes or whatever. That sounds like really simple, but they had a whole animation of the thing, and they were talking about how the pump has these three... This is how the pump works, and they had to remove this part, but they accidentally removed this part because it wasn't marked properly. And at the end, because this is a federal agency, they had like, okay, here's the recommendations that we made. It's like, you need to label these things properly, and they need to provide... They talked about the workers were contracted from another agency and they didn't have experience on the site and all that. And they went super, super... I would obviously not know anything about this. Maybe if I had looked it up on the news, it would say, oh, workers got sprayed with acid and wouldn't have told me anything more about it. But having something. It's funny because I looked in the comments and the people were like, oh my God, finally they released a new video. I'm so ready to watch this new video from the United States Chemical Safety Board. It's like, yeah, when you have something to offer, people will come.",

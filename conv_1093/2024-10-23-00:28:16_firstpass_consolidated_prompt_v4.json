    "words": "All right. Welcome to the conversation at Cortico's Local Voices Network and United Way of Dane County. Thank you for agreeing to participate. I'm starting to record and to make sure we're all on the same page. I want to share the four main purposes for this conversation. First and foremost, we want to create a new space and a new way for members of our community to listen, to and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to offer ways for members of our community to connect with and build relationships with one another. Third, we want to support LVNs new and unique technology that offers a different way to hear and lift up the voices and concerns of members of our community, like you, and share them with elected officials, local policy makers, and members of the media. And lastly, to support United Way's desire to learn directly from our community to inform their work, United Way requested this collaboration with LVN to ensure that your voices and perspectives are available to help inform their fun strategic agendas. Following your conversations today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will be transcribed and added to a collection of the United Way Centennial Conversations hosted on LVN website. The audio recording will be available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in project at Cortico and United Ways discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the public. As a participant in this conversation you are providing consent to Cortico the operator of the Local Voices Network and United Way Dane County to use the recording in accordance with the goal to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.

During our time together, we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from others in this conversation to support these goals. We have a few guidelines for our conversation. These are the same guidelines that were included in the materials we sent to confirm your participation in the meeting. One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions. Pause. Take time for reflection. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact and when possible close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you would like to add or change? All right. And the names I just did are kind of like a modified circle so we can take turns and we'll just go by that order if that's okay with all of you. To do this, I will help transition us from one person to the next. You can always pass our pass and ask for us to come back to you. And if you have any questions about this process, please let me know. And to begin, I want to do just a quick round of introductions. So if Maggie, you would like to start?",

But it also has sheltered me a little bit. The people from my area, we always say we grew up in a bubble and then when we get to college, that bubble has popped and I'm still learning and continuing to learn from different people around me.

I really struggled with trying to figure out my grocery situation because there are a few like grocery stores on campus, but the better ones where I can get a little bit more food are further out. So I had to utilize the bike paths and I didn't realize how far they cross all over Dane County. So I would take bike rides just around just to see how else I can navigate.

And I shouldn't be one to proclaim things I don't feel that's really my place. But I do need to be paying actively attention to what these people are saying so that I can make changes in my perspectives and start to think differently and more inclusively towards other people. And I don't know. I have heard of the Multicultural student center on campus. I was involved with like the ASM sustainability committee last year and we were trying to work on social sustainability, making it accessible to anybody. Because I feel like our picture of sustainability is kind of in the, what we think of sustainability is like typically like buying reusable straws, buying this, buying that, and that's kind of not accessible for everybody.

So what happens is like Anna said the video recording will be trashed and then it's just the audio recording and then we, so what mine and Anna's job, we go through these conversations and kind of listen to everything we shared and pick out different highlights. Like she said, this is all going to end in a report and I'm not totally sure what happens with that report. I know it goes to United Way. So they can figure out different events or to help with these issues that were addressed. But I'm sure if anything ended up in a newspaper or a different article, I'm sure they most likely contact you and I'm not totally sure about the answer, but that's what I can give and I can totally contact my higher up too, if you really want to know that and I can let Anna know and she can let you know if that's what you want.",

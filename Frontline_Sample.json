I think it was really interesting, because the premise of the documentary is like AI is this huge thing and it's actually taking over trucking, but also they just retired the fleet and I don't know why. I'm curious about that. I would probably want to look it up. But I also saw that it said this is a cut version of the documentary, so I assume it would go over it more. But I think that generally what resonated with me is kind of this struggle between automation and safety and then also losing jobs. Because I think outside of driving, AI has kind of become this like, oh my God, it's rising and we're losing everything. And I think that's necessarily probably true, but the way my brain works because I'm interested in policy and things like that is okay, let's say AI does rise, how do we stop gap this loss of jobs? And so it reminds me of a couple of things. I was just with a friend, 'cause we had this debate competition, we were talking about universal basic income. And that's something I had been thinking about a lot with AI, specifically this idea that if we're going to consistently lose, and it's what you would call the low skilled, which isn't necessarily true, but that's just the name we have for it, jobs to automation, how do you stop gap that? Especially because these people are talking about they're barely paid anything when they do have their jobs, what about when they don't? And I think universal basic income was something that was kind of tossing around in my mind as something that might actually need to become a reality if AI continues to rise. But those are kind of my initial thoughts. I feel like if I watch something like this and it was kind of short, I'd then spend the next 15, 20 minutes just Googling things. 'Cause I don't know, I'm like that, I needed to know more.",

I mean it was definitely an abrupt way to end the cut, but if that's not how the full documentary goes then that's fine. I was not surprised, honestly, because that whole time I was wondering, he said, \"Oh, less than half a decade.\" When did he say that? And it seems like it was before 2023, so it seems to me like a pretty clear cut case of a Silicon Valley company, an AI based Silicon Valley company making insane claims and not being able to back them up, making millions of dollars in funding and then losing it because their idea was not nearly as ready as they claimed. I mean, he showed him, like he had a golf cart, he attached what it looks to me like a motor to the steering wheel and did something like that. I mean, sure that's something, but as the driver in the second half of the video pointed out, there's so many other factors. Suddenly, oh, you have to do computer vision, sure, but then all of a sudden there are actually a hundred things you need to do and it's not nearly as simple as attaching a motor to a golf cart. And I say that because I had some experiences before doing certain programs with that sort of mentality of, oh, just look, this is our proof of concept, the golf cart. And it turns out that from there, we can do self-driving trucks, just give engineers some money in a couple of years and it'll work out. No, it does not. I think we're seeing that very often right now with most AI startups. I would go on, I would dare to say. So that was not all surprising to me. I'm interested in other perspectives on that.",

And it seems like it was before 2023, so it seems to me like a pretty clear cut case of a Silicon Valley company, an AI based Silicon Valley company making insane claims and not being able to back them up, making millions of dollars in funding and then losing it because their idea was not nearly as ready as they claimed.",

Not because of technology or AI or anything, but just because the company wasn't doing so well. So I understand whenever the people in the video were like, or the guy in the video, the truck driver when he said, \"This is what I love to do.\" And even though they're only making around $22,000 a year, that's not a lot at all, but it is what he loves to do. So when it comes to, and I don't think AI and self-driving trucks are going to be a real thing very soon. I just don't think that, because there's a lot of decision making that self-driving cars can't do. Like if a kid was coming versus a car was coming, what direction would they steer? So I don't think it's coming soon, but whenever it does, there's a lot of emotional attachment to jobs and people are going to be very angry about losing their job despite what kind of income they had. And nowadays, it is already kind of hard to find a job, especially for people who haven't gone to college and got a degree. But like I said, I don't think it's going to replace anyone's job in the near future, but I guess it is starting now.

      "words": "I was going to say two things really quickly that I think Victoria and Brianna brought up that are really interesting, 'cause it was reminding me of this idea. What is an AI going to make the decision of? It reminds me of this game that was created by literally MIT called Moral Machine and it was to collect data on what humans think is the most moral for an autonomous driving car. So it would do things like, oh, if this car has to crash into someone, make the decision, should it crash into an elderly woman or an elderly man, things like that. And A, that's scary, like what? But B, I think it's interesting, 'cause there was something the truck driver said in the video, which was really, I think it hit home for me where he was like, \"Yeah, all of this is human made and humans make mistakes.\" And I think that that's really important because we kind of have this veneer of objectivity with AI that, oh my God, it's a hundred percent safer. And that's what Alex Rodrigues was saying in the video, this is how you cut traffic collisions and traffic deaths. And maybe he's true, maybe there's some truth, or he's right, there's some truth in this fact that it might be safer. But I think that's also why we've had so many issues with algorithms being racist, being sexist, things like when Alexa and voice recognition was developed, it didn't recognize female voices because we only had male engineers on the team, things like that. I think we get so caught up with endless advancement that we don't remember that we are humans and we're making this technology and we're still wrong a bunch. And so it was kind of scary to see this guy be like, \"Yeah, it's totally cool.\" And that's why I was nodding a lot when Zahed was like, \"It sounds like a Silicon Valley dude who got a bunch of money and decided he had proof of concept he could do it.\" Because I was like, yeah, that sounds right. I think that there wasn't a lot of backing and the golf cart was very silly to me. I'm not going to lie. I was like, okay, it's a golf cart. I could drive a golf cart when I was 12, that doesn't mean I can drive a 48 wheeler. You know what I mean? And I think the other thing that Brianna brought up that was really, really interesting was the CO2 emissions because I think that's something that AI has popped up and no one thinks about, because the way AI works, it's not just something happening in the cloud. There's a bunch of servers that are working overtime. And so when you create all of these things that say powered by AI, not even trucking, but when you open Google Docs and it's like, do you want to write this thing with AI? All of that takes so much computing power. It's the same thing with NFTs where everyone was like, NFTs are really bad for the environment because all of that computing power is actually screwing up our environment. And I think that's also really important, because when you de-link the impacts of AI to what AI actually is or the real world practical, this is what it's doing to our environment, everyone's like, oh, this is cool. Even if it's creating things that aren't that great, at least it's creating something. But no, there's this idea, again, like what Brianna, what Victoria, what everyone was saying is do we actually need infinite progress or is there a second, we should take a step back and say, \"Hey, maybe this isn't cool.\" I don't know. That's kind of what I was thinking about.",

And it's the idea that of course, people can and will be driving things and making art and doing all of that. Well, as long as those things exist pretty much and we exist. But the question really, when it comes to jobs and such, is someone... Because on the one hand I agree with Martin in the sense that what you said about that's a choice. We can do something about that. We don't have to be completely pessimistic. But at the same time, a lot of the choices about AI aren't ours, ours by the perspective of let's say people who are at risk of being replaced. That's not their choice to make. That's a choice that's going to be made by someone probably on the other side of the country in a boardroom. And that person will almost certainly be choosing the AI because it makes more money.

      "words": "There was something I was thinking about that I thought was kind of unrelated to the video, but the more you guys were speaking about it, the more I was like, no. There was this YouTube video I watched a couple of days ago. It was actually by this guy named Drew Gooden, which is funny because he's a commentary YouTuber and he does a bunch of silly stuff. So you would think he doesn't talk about serious things like this, but he just made this video, I think it was called AI is Ruining the Internet. And it started off very funny, oh, here's how AI is ruining our brains, things like that. But then he started making some very interesting points about how AI is essentially devaluing human creation and art, and this idea that we can just feed a computer all of these things and it'll produce art. He opens Getty stock images and this place where you're supposed to get things like a picture of a police car or a picture of a tree, you would also be seeing people selling AI generated images for 80 bucks. And it was like, what's going on? We're devaluing what we understand human contribution to be, especially ironic because the way AI works is you have to feed them human contribution. You have to show them, here's all of these examples of human art and human creation, now go make something that's inherently less valuable because it's just kind of an amalgamation of all these things. And so when we're thinking about the documentary, and I was kind of thinking... In the beginning, I was kind of like, oh, trucking, maybe I get it. 'Cause I don't know about you, when I'm on the freeway and I'm surrounded by four four wheelers, I'm like, okay, I have to lock in because I don't know what's going on. I'm driving a super tiny car and I'm really scared. And I was like, okay, maybe it would be better if it was automated. 'Cause I think also, I'm from California and I have family friends who work in Silicon Valley, and so I'm probably more open to technology like that than a lot of people. But then also when you kind of see the human contribution side, when you're talking to this trucker family that shows, I don't know, I guess I never really considered trucking as an industry where people put their heart and soul into. But then she was like, we pay this much for gas and we do this for the parts, and he's sleeping in the car. I think that was really interesting to me because it kind of shifted my perspective from the purely non-emotional, yeah, it's bad, the jobs are getting taken away, to also this is something that someone can take as much ownership of as creating art. Right? It's just as important. I think I never really likened to the two, but seeing the humanity behind it, I think in that sense it changed my mind. I was always pretty like, no, taking jobs is pretty bad, but I think that it's shown a new aspect of it for me. Also, Brianna, the Facebook, the nonstop AI generated pictures, I think that's how that video started and I was like, oh, this is stupid. It's hilarious, but it's stupid. And then I was reading more about it and I was like, this is scary. This is really bad. But, yeah.",

Earlier about just the video in general, I would say that I personally kind of got most of my preexisting beliefs validated, so I wouldn't say it completely destroyed. But if they were, the moment I was wondering... Okay, wait, this is going to be interesting. They were telling the woman who was in trucking that like, \"Oh yeah, this company, Embark, is already doing self-driving trucking.\" I don't know, I guess maybe I just missed it, that Embark was the company that guy was talking about before. Probably should have connected the dots there. But if they were like, oh, I didn't know about that, maybe if that's actually happening, then maybe that's an interesting discussion. And then no, actually the company shut down because of all the reasons that we were talking about. So that was not particularly shocking to me. About what Ayushi was saying, I would think that generally, you mentioned that AI is built off of human people putting things, like genuine human stuff like art and such into it. It's also kind of another angle on that that I saw is when it comes to especially the computer vision problems that he was talking about earlier, is there are people who are paid to do work on training AI through programs like Amazon's Mechanical Turk and stuff like that. And they are generally people who are in overseas and do not have very many opportunities, and this opportunity is, and they're being paid very little for this type of thing. So the idea is that not only are we just taking from human artists and going down art station just scraping down everything you can see there, but also we're creating a whole new industry full of human people who are not... That too. Yeah. I'm glad you mentioned that, because sometimes when it's fake, it's just people and then when it's real, it's also a lot of people in India. So I think my point being that the fact that AI, we kind of see as like, oh, if we take the humans out of the equation, then those people aren't going to be in this industry anymore. But we've kind of created a new industry and has all the carbon emissions of... I mean, I'm not sure where that compares with trucking, but it's like every problem that we're trying to escape with AI, at least the way that it's pitched, shows up in the production of AI.",

And like Zahed said, every single aspect that we're trying to fix, there's a downside for it. And everything that involves AI, there also happens to be a downside for it. And so when people think of AI, they're going to think of, or they might think of self-driving cars and think that's a big problem. But I think just the smallest things of students writing essays with AI is something that needs to be addressed. At my school actually, all the freshmen, I want to say... Okay, we have a class of freshmen that's I think is like 170. Out of 170 people, only 10 of them didn't use AI for this one assignment, and they all got caught. And the teachers were so mad, some of them were literally crying because they spent so much time into these lesson plans and it felt like the students weren't putting the work into it and it really hurt them. And that's insane because freshmen, guys, your work is not hard first of all, and you have to write this one paper on any topic, any subject of your choice, and you're choosing not to write it. And that just shows that we're actually making real life duds, people who cannot think for themselves because they're relying so much on this. And I know some of them are still going to use it. And now apparently Google Classroom has this AI detection thing. I don't even know, but it's necessary. And it's so scary to think that, I think Zahed said it or I don't know who said it, or I think Ayushi, I don't know, but just how creativity is going down just because of the use of AI, because people can't problem solve. It's so easy to make art. It's just so easy to do everything. And making things easier for people is the exact opposite of what it means to make change. And I don't know what we can do to help people realize that that's not the solution right now that we should be focusing on.",

He had a very exaggerated example where he was like, \"Okay, imagine you're walking into a doctor's office and you're getting a surgery done or whatever, and they're like, 'Okay, give me one second, chat GPT is just helping me out with prepping this surgery.'\" And he's like, \"How would you feel in that situation?\" It's a very, very exaggerated example, but hearing him talk about it, I was like, okay, this is very concerning. So that is a question that I still have, and I'm really just worried that in the future, whether it just be with us writing our essays or creating art, all of that, AI is literally just going to take over.

I watched a video, I think, last week, and it was about this girl who created an Instagram account that was completely from AI generated, like from this AI generated girl. And she was talking about how it was first of all kind of easy as of right now to tell whether it's an AI picture for at least for creating a human model. Just because for example, she would keep getting seven fingers or the background would be a little bit messed up, it would be warped and the trees wouldn't look like trees, et cetera. A lot of those things. But she says that it really shocked her because she went into it thinking that people would immediately catch on that it's completely AI generated from the get-go. But that didn't happen actually, there were a lot of simps on Instagram was what she realized. And she was also looking through a lot of other accountants and she realized that she was not the only person who was doing this. She did that out of a social experiment sort of, but she realized that a lot of people are actually profiting off of AI generated pictures. And they were creating stuff like OnlyFans with AI generation, which I didn't even know could be possible until I heard her talk about it. But yeah, I think it's just, I really like the points that you guys brought up in terms of where do we draw the line? And I think as of right now, even after watching this video, I think it's something that we haven't gotten a grasp on yet. I think we have been very focused on thinking about how we can move forward with technology in the future and where AI can conquer more industries and make a bigger impact in a lot of different fields. But in terms of how it really affects us as human beings, I think that's also something that is being put to the side in terms of thinking about how we progress.

We have pretty similar reactions, and I think that that's kind of a product of the people that are here. A lot of us know each other, if we don't know each other we're from generally similar backgrounds. We're all, I think, the same age, just graduated high school-ish, like around there. And so I think that also goes to show that we probably all had similar reactions 'cause we're coming from similar places, but I'm curious if we did bring someone from Victoria's school who was in that freshman class, what they would think. Or that friend she was talking about, or even to an extent more guys. Sorry Martin, but you know what I mean? I think we're having this conversation about how progress and AI is inherently probably a little bit more masculine, which is so interesting, and I hadn't heard by the way, that was really cool and I'm going to go look into that more. But also then having that conversation and also having one guy here, I think that was cool because while this conversation was really interesting to me, I think a lot of us have kind of said, yeah, that video was cool, but I think it reinforced my beliefs. And me too, but I'm curious because I would love to talk more to people who are pro AI and hear a little bit more about it. 'Cause I do think transparently that a lot of my beliefs on AI have come from just self conceived and self-built notions. And I want to hear more about, because it can't just be this, right? It can't just be the eight of us that are like, yeah, AI sucks pretty much. There has to be a reason, other than boardrooms and people are like, this saves money. There definitely is individual level buy-in to AI, and I want to know why. That's very interesting to me, and I think that that's something that I would've loved to hear, but obviously sometimes the dice doesn't roll that way. That's kind of what I was thinking.",

And I agree, I think maybe I should have went a little more diverse and found people who have some different point of views as well. I think it would be very interesting to hear about it. But a thought I like to introduce as well is that I feel like a lot of people aren't that entirely knowledgeable about AI, just in terms of the concept of how it works. I think most people at this point have a very basic understanding of what AI is and essentially what it's generating into the world, but not necessarily about its mechanics. Even when I talk to my family members about AI, I feel like they kind of use it as some sort of jargon just in normal conversations, and it doesn't feel like they necessarily know the impact that it actually has.

      "words": "I think when you mentioned people who are being knowledgeable about AI, I think the question Ayushi just asked, like what is the buy-in for our everyday people? I think we mentioned a little bit of that before, which is that this abstract notion of progress and such that it's a new shiny thing. It's like, oh, look at that. It is an innovation, yes, for sure. And also the fact, like Victoria mentioned, the ease of use, and you can call it, oh, you're taking away creativity, which is true, it's the easy way out, it's true. But people are going to take the easy way out, at least some people. So, I would not. In terms of their individual buy-in, those sort of benefits I think are pretty clear cut. But when it comes to like, oh, at least in my perspective of people, which of course is going to be biased because I'm not one of those people, but in my perspective of people who are very optimistic towards AI and also think positively of it, the idea I see being thrown around the most is like, oh, it's going to have exponential growth. And okay, sure, the AI images suck right now, and you can tell, and ChatGPT can't do anything technical because it'll say a bunch of random false information now. But none of this existed two years ago, so two years from now, who knows? And that's an argument. I have issues with that, but it's definitely an argument and there's a grain of truth I would say, because I'm sure AI will continue to improve to an extent. The question, which it's going to be harder to answer is where and how and such. But if you are optimistic on that, it's pretty easy for you to imagine a world where, okay, well sure if ChatGPT says false information 50% of the time now, if we cut that in half in two years and we keep cutting that in half and all that, then at some point it'll be reliable enough for everyone to use and such. That's, I think, the idea of trends. You also mentioned, Jessie, people knowing how AI works, like under the hood and all that, so to speak. Which is something, I mean, I don't have in-depth knowledge of, but I would say a passing amount of information in. And the answer is that it's a whole lot of linear algebra is what it is. And being exposed to that, if you see AI as I would say the vast majority of people do, like Jessie's parents, it's like, oh, it's like a black box. You put some stuff into it and it'll come out, and it'll give you something. Who knows what it'll give you. It could give you great things or whatever, right? But when you go into the nitty-gritty of it, it's a lot of math. It's an algorithm. I mean, it's definitely very different to the usual thing that we think of when we think of algorithms. It's something that has a capacity of learning and such, and that's very interesting from a scientific and mathematical perspective and whatnot. But I think after learning about that, every time I think about, oh, this is an AI tool or whatever, ChatGPT is doing all this stuff. But when you look at ChatGPT, it's like, okay, going to turn all these words into vectors and stuff, and then it's going to do a whole bunch of layers on it. And then it's going to tell me, it's going to generate a probability distribution of what the next most common word is. And then it's going to choose something based on a variable, and it's just going to keep doing that until the most common thing that's selected is end of a prompt. And I think having that just a little bit of base, little bit of technical information about AI kind of bursts a lot of the illusions for me, because it's not a magic thing. And I mean, I say magic is just obviously probably kind of a derogatory term for, I'm assuming people who are all generally believers in science and such. People don't want to say it's like magic, but when you see a technology, and this goes for things that are not just AI, but when you see something that is having these great results and it seems to be up on the improvement, and everyone, I mean a lot of people in powerful positions in Silicon Valley and such are optimistic about it, I think it's definitely easy to make that sort of... Think, okay, this is just going to work and I'm just going to believe in it because that's the information I have. And I don't blame people for that. I think that's probably a common experience.",

We check how much time there is and how much time we have available. And I think that's also what they're getting at as well.

But I would say that even for me, if I'm watching a YouTube video and let's say if I have, I don't know, a 30-minute lunch, I would kind of think about in terms of time, how much time I'm willing to invest in watching a certain thing and how interested I would be to spend a certain amount of time onto it.

So before we go, please stay on the call and just complete this post survey. So it's a second set of questions to help us capture the value and impact of our small group facilitated conversation. And when you're done, feel free to leave. And thank you so much for staying 30 minutes over time, but this went really well. Thank you guys. And kind of as a reminder, so I'm really sorry, I guess my text didn't send. I actually emailed you guys an opportunity that's available through Frontline right now. It's making social media content for them. And I think you will be compensated via gift card. Oh, and about the gift card. I know I said before that the gift card was a merchant of your choice, but I think that might have been misinformation. I think it's going to be an Amazon gift card. I hope that's still okay with you guys. But if you guys don't like Amazon, let me know. I'll talk to them. But yeah, they also have another opportunity. I emailed you and it is something called a Storytellers Club I believe. And essentially it's just helping them make social media content that will be available to the younger audience.

So before we begin, I'm just going to put some agreements in the chat for the conversations so everyone can follow, so we can have a successful conversation with everybody. If everyone just wants to look at those for a sec, then we get started. All right. So if we want to just go around, do a couple quick introductions, that would be good. I'm Nick.

So, speak for yourself and your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, take turns, and allow others to finish speaking. Stay curious. conversations. Pause, take time for reflection. Number six, listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Number seven, show that you're listening actively. Head nods, eye contact, reactions in the chat. And number eight, but not least, close distractions on your laptop, phone, and pay attention.

A lot of people don't know this, but it's remarkably hard for computers until very, very recently to do even the most basic visual tasks like seeing a picture of a person and knowing that it's a person. And we've made gigantic strides with artificial intelligence and being able to see and understanding tasks, and that's obviously fundamental to being able to understand the world around you with the sensors that you have available.

We all have different views on it. My dad, he'll always critique that the dependency that people use, like their rear cameras as a way to park or whatever. He'll be like, \"This generation, this...\" And I'm like, \"Well...\" It's a way to help them, but it's also the dependency of just looking at a camera instead of looking at just your other surroundings.

I hint this earlier where I think at the end we saw this collectiveness where all three of you guys were like, AI in education and how photo math or chat GPT, and you saw that some kids don't even know how to do basic math. And for me, I've experienced that. Whenever I take some of my classes, I noticed that... How are you in this class when you weren't able to do basic math? And it's a little concerning at times. So it's like, obviously Chat GPT hasn't been out long enough, but I fear that as it gets even further, what's going to happen is these classes like these especially college level classes where... Because the one thing about in high school is that teachers, they want you to pass in your classes, they're just like that. But in college, professors, to some certain extent, they don't really care. It's on you, right? College is all about yourself and what you make out of it.

The first one, speak for yourself and on your own experiences, not others. I'll allow others to speak for themselves. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, take turns, allow others to finish speaking. Number four, stay curious, ask honest questions. I should be seeing head nods throughout this entire thing, preferably. Number five, pause. Take time for reflection. Number six, listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Number seven?",

So in one person's experiment they asked ChatGPT to write a poem about Joe Biden and ChatGPT therefore wrote a poem about Joe Biden. And then preceedingly, the user asked ChatGPT to write a poem about Donald Trump and ChatGPT responded saying, \"I will avoid this prompt considering it's most likely politically incorrect.\" Something along those lines to avoid any controversy. This created a huge issue on the internet where people were fighting and people were saying, \"ChatGPT is biased, ChatGPT is all the way on the left.\" And after a while ChatGPT developers came out and said, \"this is a mistake on our part.

But I don't think it does a great job at hooking someone. And however, if I watched two, three minutes into it, I definitely think I would've watched into the end. What would've made me enjoy it more? Like I said, a super vibrant hook at the beginning in the first 30, 15 seconds is what really gets a lot of people, considering attention spans are dipping exponentially. You need to have a really good hook. And this unfortunately did not have the greatest hook in my opinion, of course. I didn't really find anything confusing. The beginning was a little bit boring, but nothing really was confusing for me. I think it did a really good job of explaining who everyone and why they were in the documentary. Would I share? I think I 100% would. I think Frontline did a really good job of creating the emotional difference between two people.

The MIT group designing this conversation is finding that this approach helps build connections and deepen mutual understanding. Before we begin, let's review some conversation agreements, including some baseline agreements. We're not on Zoom today, so I'll just say them out loud. If you disagree or you want to add anything to these conversation agreements, let me know. Speak for yourself and on your own experience. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Take turns and allow others to finish speaking. Stay curious. Ask honest questions. Pause. Take time for reflection. Listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Show that you're listening actively. Head nods, eye contact, and reactions in the chat help show people you are paying close attention to them. Close distractions on your laptop or phone to pay attention to each other as much as possible. Is everyone on board with these guidelines?",

Luckily, because we're in person, we actually watched the clip on the TV before the conversation happens, so we can ignore that and that's why conversation will be 10 minutes shorter. All right, so we can jump right in. I'm going to ask a question and you guys, it's kind of up to you. I'm going to be answering the questions as well, but you guys, it's pure free conversation. Pass the phone around to speak into the mic and it should be a free flowing conversation. What are your first thoughts after watching the video? More specifically, can anyone relate to anything in the documentary personally? It doesn't have to be about airlines or Boeing, not specifically, but maybe mirrors the emotional and interpersonal issues that people are facing in the clip. I think this question is less about the documentary and its details and more about the documentary and its emotional appeal. I'll give you guys 10, 20 seconds to think about that one.",

However, when talking about the opportunity with my parents, they brought up a story of their friend who had flown on a private jet about 20 years or so ago and he passed away in an accident on that plane. That personally affected them as he was one of their very close friends. That affected them on a very deep level, but it also created a sense of fear, which was difficult for them to talk about to me directly. One, because it hurt them to talk about losing their friend, but also because they don't want to take away from something from me, but they also want to protect me, and I think looking about that situation, it can be seen as one in a million or one in a hundred thousand of situations that occur like that, but the fact is that there is still that risk and that's just a difficult thing to talk about, and especially once it's related to someone and it can be a difficult thing for you to warn someone about even when it's not that common.",

I think that's something important for them to look at and to think about how they can treat their employees better, but on the other hand, how they can also prepare the flight attendants as well, and I think that just talks a lot about companies in general, how they need to respond to change in difficult situations when they're faced with these challenges and how they have to be better. I think their CEO was talking about that, who took full responsibility and said he came out and he was like, \"It's completely our fault.

I was like, if that was me on the plane, and I got off and I somehow survived that, the only thing I heard from a CEO was, \"Yeah, we own it. It was our mistake,\" I don't know.

There's no impacts. There's no solutions. We're just scared that this company has no oversight, but there's literally nothing else we can do. They're the only company kind of in this space, and the FAA seems to be taking steps, but from our perspective, the only thing you can do is just joke about it and move on, at least from my perspective.",

I probably don't have a choice over what kind of make it is in a more general term. For example, the phone that we choose to purchase, or maybe even a coffee that we choose to buy from those places, what affects us as consumers?

Every other time, it was a Boeing like a Boeing 737 or some other thing. And so thinking about, Jessie, what you asked and, Zahed, what you were just saying, again, in terms of corporate accountability, we don't really get to choose. When you're flying on a plane and you're on Google Flights, it's not like, oh, here's Boeing and here's an Airbus, right? It's like, here's Alaska, here's American. This is $700, this is $600, this is this time, right? So it's also kind of hard, I think, when you want to have a conversation about Boeing because, aside from, oh, it's scary that they have no safety regulations, consumers kind of also don't feel a sense of ownership over this direct choice that they're making, because they don't really have a choice. It's not like, I'm going to boycott Starbucks because I don't feel like I want to support that message. It's not like I can say, okay, I'm not going to fly on Boeing planes anymore, because that's just not possible. And so even like, Ritika, if you're flying next week, unfortunately, you're probably flying on a Boeing plane. I don't know.

That was really interesting and I didn't know that, because it seems like such a simple oversight.

I think it answered my question of why Boeing is failing or safety failures, because I knew that was happening, I didn't know why, but I would just like to know, and I still have questions about, why this is happening in other sectors as well, and if there's some evil corporation that's killing off their whistleblowers.

And understanding, as Martin mentioned, and as we all saw, he was like, we own it, but what measures did he take? Because saying that a company owns something, in comparison to the personal CEO, I'm pretty sure he was also with the DOJ. There was an article and they were asking him about how much he gets paid. They were questioning that, in correlation with how Boeing is doing, you're getting paid way too much. And that was kind of just a lot of words that didn't go together that well. But in conclusion, I wish I would've kind of known more about how he personally, if he made any changes to how he's managing, because I'm pretty sure issues like this started happening directly after he took place, because as the John Oliver episode mentioned that Boeing used to have a huge culture of accountability.

He hasn't been with Boeing for a really long time.

It's kind of similar, in terms of long form documentary adjacent things, it's kind of similar to your average, not saying not average, but a lot of YouTube video essays also, in the sense of, things that are very good at delivering meaningful deep information that it's not... In both of those cases, unless it's really bad, I never walk out of the video thinking like, okay, well, I already knew all this already. I didn't learn anything today. That never happens. I think just because of the fact that they have more time, and then they make it more interesting with style and filmmaking stuff, rather than your typical documentary style, which is kind of dry.",

And I think, another part of that too, and why there's not necessarily more to disagree on, is because, there wasn't necessarily elements in the video that were spoken about for a long time that are supposed to pull the heartstrings like last week when they had the specific interview from people it impacted. So if we could have gotten an interview with, instead of just professionals, someone who was on the flight, on any of the flights that they talk about, or an interview with someone who knew the whistleblower who passed away.

It was like, oh, before 1997 we used to do it like this, and then afterwards it was like this. Or something really basic like that, because they mentioned company culture, and we have nothing other than they don't seem to check things. I think, the company, Boeing would never describe their culture as, oh yeah, we just don't check things and stuff. If you had the perspective of someone on the ground, so to speak, something like that, they could say that, oh, hey, suddenly, all the higher ups told us that this wasn't worth checking, or something like that. I don't know what they would say, because I haven't seen the interview, because they didn't do it. But it would be very interesting if that was the case, because that seems like exactly what this sort of format is for, and actually talking to people who are involved, not just on the plane, but also at the site of the problem. Also, I think the other thing is, the good thing about the last video was that, it was very like, this is just because of how the nature of any sort of discourse about AIs is. It's always like, oh, in the future, it's going to be like this. And so all the interviews, I'm like, oh, maybe other than that one guy, the truck driver, they're like, oh, in the future, when AI comes, I don't think it'll be able to do this, I think it'll be able to do. That's interesting, because then at least you have some amount of... You have facts, but there's also amount of speculation and you have to think about different things, whereas this was pretty much all about the past. Everything that's happened now has happened. There isn't really any sort of future outlook, about anything, about Boeing or about consumers' choices, or about safety or really any sort of... We've been trying.

And it started with them talking about how they figured out the problem because, I mean, this is aimed at pilots and stuff like that. It was like, hey, we noticed that the takeoff was fine, and then suddenly, the nose wanted to keep going down after. And like, oh, we just realized, oh, shoot, it was the trim and all that. But then, they also had an interview with the mechanic, the one who actually messed it up. And he said that, \"Yeah, I've done this a thousand times. I've heard of this happening, but I always thought that I would just do it right. I didn't believe them at first when they said that, oh, the trim was messed up. But then we went in and we looked at it, and yeah, they got swapped.\" To be honest, even that was pretty dry and just recollecting the facts, but at least having the perspective and having the story of like, oh, we tried doing this, but that didn't fix What did they do?

But I think on a larger level about consumer services and things, it's applicable. Because the way concert insurance actually works is, let's say Ticketmaster sells you a ticket. Concert insurance is an extra 20 bucks or however much you said, but it's actually facilitated by a different company. So that different company is basically saying, if we collect enough 20 bucks from people and then you can't go because you have to be in the hospital or like, oh, you forgot a friend's birthday party, we'll refund your ticket. But Ticketmaster is not entitled or is not... You're not entitled to get a refund from them, you can only have ticket insurance. But then if you read the ticket insurance, it also says something like, oh, but if their concert's canceled, we're not going to pay you back, or things like that. So there's niches and little loopholes there. So I think, bringing it back to corporate accountability, it's interesting because you see that a lot of different corporations, I mean obviously their goal is to make profit, but there's also a difference between being... I mean, it's early, so I'm just going to say, there's a difference between being shitty and being a reasonable corporation. I think that's an oxymoron at this point. But the hope is that, that's not an oxymoron, and we kind of learn how to have good business practices. But when I'm watching this thing about Boeing and like, yes, it is a little dry and it's kind of straightforward and informative, but I'm also learning, oh, the door flew off because they didn't screw in bolts, and because no one knew they didn't screw in bolts. I'm like, damn, that's not cool. We are really, really screwed, I think, if this is the level at which our corporations don't have accountability because they don't care about the consumer, they care about the profit.

I look things up as they're happening because I like to learn more about it. And it also said that his predecessor was fired because of what happened to Ethiopia and Indonesia. Those planes crashed. He was fired. And then Calhoun is brought in as a CEO. And then they asked him to make a public comment on it, and he was like, \"Yeah, this was an issue. It was probably our fault for expecting the pilots to be able to fix it. But also, pilots in Ethiopia and Indonesia aren't as experienced as US pilots.\" Then someone asked him, \"Do you think this would've happened if the pilots were American?\" And he was like, \"No.\" And I was like, what's going on? Again, this idea that corporations are basically scapegoating their way out of these things. \"Yeah, it's our fault. We'll own it, but we're not owning it.\" That is so concerning, especially when you consider regulations are written in blood.

Yeah, that's interesting. I find it interesting, at least in my experience of watching John Oliver, is that he starts this video by saying, okay, so we're going to talk about this now, and it's the least interesting way to start a video. But obviously, I think the reason why we keep watching that is just because it's always something going... It's we kind of have that level of trust that, sure, whatever he is going to say is going to be important, so it's worth sticking around.

But it's like, when you have, adding on to Zahed's point, when you have a constant narrator that's kind of like the same voice, I guess, there is a relationship, sort of, that you have with that narrator over time, where you kind of get comfortable with their voice and the content that they have to say. And what I noticed about this documentary was that, I think, maybe because it's primarily based off of a certain expert they hire for the specific video, it's a different person. So just as soon as we got used to the last video talking about AI and all of that, I guess, in this video, it seemed like it could have been made by a completely other... He's British.

And I mentioned earlier, video essays are similar in that sense that it's one person almost always, and you get familiar with their voice, and that gives you a sort of... When you have that relationship, you have a level of trust also. Peer-reviews videos were good, and also just the fact that it's a person. I saw this interesting discussion about it in that, we talk about clickbait on YouTube and all that. A lot of video essays have reverse clickbait, where the title is something kind of nondescript, and it's a fairly simple question that's answered fairly early. But then after that, or in the process of answering the question, it's actually much more interesting. And there's all sorts of other connections that you would've never known if you had just looked at the title or the thumbnail. Right, yeah, everyone talks about that, but it's like, that's the whole genre and people like that because, A, they like having actual deep, deep, I mean, that's such an overused word, but deep level of insight, and also having a voice that you can trust and that you can relate to. And I'm just going to say, from what I've been seeing, I don't think they have any of that. I think that's a very good question.

It's a company that makes documentaries and they have a pretty long-standing season format or whatever, so they have a brand. They have a brand identity, and I'm not sure if they're testing out a new spinoff show or something like that. But I think what Zahed was saying is, you're watching these videos and if you can't tell they're made by the same person, or you couldn't tell who it was made by, you could say it was made by this guy or this guy or this guy, I think that's important because you build that trust when have that brand identity. Just really weird. That sounds like I'm a marketing major who's just trying to say, trust me, I promise, but there is some truth in it, right? I'm going to click a video from the same guy, versus I'm not really sure... Or someone I've watched before and I know their style and I trust, versus I'm not really sure if it's just kind of bland. And so obviously, when you watch something new, you're trying it out. But I think making sure, from last week, and then we can also see this again maybe next week and the week after, unless there's a consistent style across the documentaries, I think you kind of lose a little bit of trust in your audience because there's not... I think personality is a little bit more important in documentaries and making sure that people want to stick and want to stay through. So whether that's having a consistent narrator through them or bringing in more empathy into the storytelling, like Brianna was talking about, any of those things can work. I think it's kind of trial and error, but that's what sticks out to me also.",

The thing is that, even other documentaries, I mean, I've been comparing this documentary to things that aren't strictly documentaries, but even other actual documentaries, there are other ways of making something distinct. My first thought is graphics or something, show connections visually, and then you have a visual style for those graphics, something that is a little more interesting than just, okay, here's someone talking.

So I think it's just like, they have to give us something that we can't just get from a million other places. So humanity is definitely one of them. If you can tell a human story about the incident, then that's a leg up over the Wikipedia article for Alaska Airlines incident. I think another example is that of something I just was notified to. Someone sent me this video, from the US Chemical Safety Board, and it was similar in a sense that it's an incident that was caused by a lack of regulation or whatever, but because these are the people investigating it, it was actually a very comprehensive engineering level breakdowns. And also, the incident in question, I think it was a bunch of acids spilled out on some workers because they accidentally unscrewed... They were trying to replace a pump and they accidentally unscrewed the cap to one of the tubes or whatever. That sounds like really simple, but they had a whole animation of the thing, and they were talking about how the pump has these three... This is how the pump works, and they had to remove this part, but they accidentally removed this part because it wasn't marked properly. And at the end, because this is a federal agency, they had like, okay, here's the recommendations that we made. It's like, you need to label these things properly, and they need to provide... They talked about the workers were contracted from another agency and they didn't have experience on the site and all that. And they went super, super...

I'll post them in the chat. Let me know if you're on board with them. If not, let me know as well. I think we've gone through these last few times, so I don't think it's needed. Is everyone good with these? Alrighty, sweet. We don't need introductions. Now I'm going to play the audio. I'm going to share my screen with audio and play the clip we'll discuss today. The topic will be child hunger. As you're watching, try to notice ideas that do or do not resonate with you. Think about how you feel when different people are talking. We'll discuss about this later. Okay, let me share my screen. Oh shoot, this is only two minutes long. It's not even 10 minutes. Oh, wow. Okay. Sorry, I'm not even sharing. Share. Share. Alrighty.",

Let's take a moment to see where reactions were similar or different and why that might be. What stood out to you from what others? Sorry, I cannot speak. What stood out to you from what others shared in the group? I'll start. I'll also put this in the chat. That's a good idea because sometimes I can't read. I feel like we had a lot of similar thoughts, even though some of them might not be held by most people. I think in here we held pretty similar views about how the people's situation in the video is probably mostly brought up by their parents, and obviously not the child's fault, because what they suffered through is an effect of what their parents were doing and their decisions.

It's not going to end up in any way, shape, or form to be good.\" And when it comes up to school shootings is the most common one, my grandma will always express her worries like, \"It hasn't happened there yet, but you never know when it might happen at your school or around the area at some point.\" So the conversations never ended up with me being frustrated, it just ends up with us being in agreement that there is something more that needs to be done about gun regulations and gun control, not just in a few states, but around the whole country.",

Go do whatever you want with it.\" But however, here in the US there's something different from Venezuela, that we have the second amendment here. You have the right to bear arms. Of course we can't take that away because yes, it's an amendment right. However, there is things that we can do to minimize access to that. Not take that right away completely, but regulate it. In Texas, you shouldn't be able to walk around with an AK-47 on openly in the street. What's the name? You shouldn't just be allowed to own multiple guns and just have them in the backyard of your house. You shouldn't just be able to carry that, even hiding it into somewhere where it's not allowed, period. And some states are doing something about it, but then there's states that are just turning a blind eye to it and not regulating their gun laws. Texas is a big big example, Southern states are a big example. Just those states that generally just think that people should just carry that around. And even as a child care worker, when they said, \"Oh yeah, we should allow teachers to carry guns in their classrooms for safety,\" I feel like that wouldn't even be a solution either because what would it do? It wouldn't solve anything. It would just amplify the big issue that already is because you never know.

No one got shot, but they had to go on lockdown and SWAT came. They were in classrooms hiding for hours and she was actively texting me because we had just gone on summer break. It was the last week for her, and she was actively texting me through it like, \"Oh, there's SWAT here. They're someone on campus with a gun.\" And so I kind of relate to what Gary was saying, that this is happening because even though I wasn't there, her reaction and knowing that she's in danger was like, \"Whoa.\" And to see that her school now has metal detectors that they all have to go through every morning and they have to wear clear backpacks because a kid decided to bring one of those Airsoft or BB guns that looks like an AK-47 onto school campus. You don't really realize what kind of impact guns will have on you until you're kind of put in the position, so my reaction is kind of similar to those two when they brought up their feelings on guns.",

You're supposed to think about, \"There are children dying in Africa,\" things like that, but I do think child poverty and child hunger in the US, but also in developed countries, is a really serious issue that a lot of people don't know about. So I actually appreciated that they took a specific look at that. I think the other thing I was thinking about, that was kind of interesting, was this idea that children who don't have food or they have food insecurity, get fed at school, because that's just something I've been paying attention to. In California, we have free lunch, but it was a whole thing, because everyone was like, \"Oh. Why are we having free lunch for everybody?\" Then, also we heard about Tim Waltz when he got nominated, and his whole thing, it wasn't his whole thing, but one of the biggest things he did was free lunch for Minnesota school children. And so, that was really interesting to me, because I think it's such an odd issue to be contentious about, but it just goes to show that people can argue about anything, so those are kind of the two things I was thinking about.",

We have two ways, generally, of categorizing poverty. One is, as Martin said, just kind of like, \"Oh. It's somewhere out there, in Africa or wherever,\" whatever country is going through something right now, and so it's not really in our mind. The other one, the other way of thinking of poverty, is they deserve it, which is the two main narratives about poverty in the United States. People would be like, \"I don't think the kid deserves it for being poor,\" but usually when it comes to the idea of pre-lunch and stuff, it's like, \"Oh. The parents shouldn't be relying on things. That'll just keep them from taking responsibility,\" or something like that. I mean, that's generally how those conversations go. Personally, I haven't directly engaged too much.

    "words": "So I think it's a slow morning. It's taking me a little bit to process, but one of the things that I was kind of thinking about was, at least in my high school, I remember the switch to free lunch. I remember we used to pay for lunch, and they kind of had free or reduced lunch, and then everyone paid for lunch. I mean, didn't pay for lunch, like they passed a bill and it was free lunch. People were kind of like, \"Oh. That's weird,\" but then it ended up being a really good thing, not only for the people who were food insecure, but then you had people who probably could afford food, but they were actually eating lunch for once in their lives. They weren't forgetting to eat, they weren't not packing food, because they realized, \"Oh, it's there. Let me just go eat something,\" so it ended up being a net positive for everyone. I mean, other than just the baseline, \"Yes, we should feed our kids,\" it was one of the most beneficial arguments to why we should provide this baseline. I think the other thing I was thinking about was, during COVID, when everything was shut down, schools became, at least in California, the place for people to get their food. They were still providing free lunch. They had drop-offs, they had places for people to come in and get their food, and I know because I had some people I know volunteer at the school, helping with distribution and helping make sure, and a lot of people actually came and grabbed food because this is what they relied on, and so I think that was really important. I have never really had a conversation with someone who is anti providing, not just kids free lunch, but I guess things like that, but what I do think is kind of funny is when this topic, like very recently with Tim Waltz, came in the mainstream, one of my favorite teachers I follow on Instagram, and he posted this thing about, it was just this joke. It was someone he was making fun of. He was like, \"Who is going to pay for kids free lunch? Who's going to pay for kids free lunch?\" He was like, \"Me. I will pay for kids free lunch,\" because I think the issue is when people are arguing about, \"\"Why do my taxes have to be taken for your mistake? It was kind of reassuring to see that that's not the majoritarian narrative. There are a lot of people who are like, \"Actually, no. This is important. We should pay for our kids' free lunch.\" As someone who is still a teenager, it was kind of scary for a second for a lot of people to be like, \"Tim Waltz did something wrong.\" I was like, \"What? That's crazy,\" so yeah, I think that was important. The last thing is, I know we're talking a lot about school lunches and things like that, which is important, but the other thing is I think child hunger and child poverty is such an issue in urban areas because of food deserts. I know in LA, a lot of people's closest grocery store is a liquor store. Some of my friends, I remember we wanted snacks, and so we would have to go walk to a liquor store nearby to grab snacks, and I was like, \"That's crazy.\" I feel like that's also such an under, I don't want to say under-understood. I don't know what the word I'm looking for, I'm searching for right now, is part of the reason why we have so much food insecurity in the US.",

You did something to get up to where you are. But the flip side of that, the natural flip side, the unavoidable flip side is that, if you are poor, then you have failed to do something or you've done something wrong and such.

With the amount of people like attending church decreasing, a resource for a lot of food insecure families also diminished. So not only did that change how some people were aiding that need, there's just so many different contributors that, like I said, changed after COVID.

This is edited for Instagram, like the square post. It's edited for Instagram, and it's edited short for Instagram. It kind of reminds me of a lot of the news videos that you see there, because the subtitles are there, so you can watch it on mute and you can still watch it and things like that, which I think makes sense to me, right? Because if you're editing something for social media, it needs to be short, and it kind of needs to be emotional so people watch it, which I think, and I can expand on this later, isn't beneficial, but it's also not the worst thing, because I think if you're putting something on social media, the idea is not necessarily, \"Oh, let's spark a lot of conversations.\" It's kind of like, \"Let's bring awareness to this issue,\" and that's a whole other, I think, issue with social media, but I think that's also kind of what the format is there, right? It's like, \"This is an issue. Now you're aware of it,\" type beat, so that is what I was thinking concerning this. I don't think they were trying to challenge anyone's assumptions that child poverty is bad, but more like, \"Hey, this is a thing,\" because there are some people that don't know this is a thing. I'm thinking of teenagers who are not really, I don't want to say I'm relegating to slang right now, I'm like teenagers who aren't captain. You know what I mean?

Anyways, so I was thinking about, we talked a little bit about the cons, I guess, per se, about why some people are okay, in theory, about children going hungry, and it made me think about, maybe I think a lot of people mentioned that they didn't have the chance to talk to someone like that, which I think is, to be honest, I think a good thing, more than anything. But for me, personally, I feel like some of the arguments that I've heard, because I feel like I've had those conversations even with some members of my community, is that it feels like, sorry, I got distracted by [Ritika]'s, is that a dog? Where is the dog? Oh, so cute. Oh, I actually forgot what I was going to say. That dog was really cute. Anyway, I think some people, another I guess argument that some people would bring up in conversations is that people become dependent on handouts, like when they're offered free resources or reduced resources. I guess this all goes back to the American dream narrative, that I think Zahad had mentioned, which is that if you work hard, then you're going to have a good life. That's the whole premise of, we're in a country of opportunity, and so if you're here and you're willing to be able to work every single day, and you're not going to take no for an answer, at the end, you're going to win in life. For example, poverty wouldn't even be something that's on your path. That kind of made me think about people who supposedly have made it, and obviously, I think in their life they've had a lot of different opportunities and people who are willing to support them to get there as well, but what's interesting is that oftentimes when I talk to these people, kind of at their prime, at a time where they don't really have to worry about poverty as much anymore, they kind of start having this different mentality, which is that, \"I made it here because I never relied on free or reduced resources. I made it here because I went to bed hungry. I was willing to wake up early every single day, and I went to work, and I didn't complain about it,\" so that was just something that I thought about when we were having the conversation, but is there anyone else who wants to make a connection?",

The interviewer asked me like, \"Oh. What's a project you've been working on?\" So I was telling them about my work with legal aid and helping people get resources to get their citizenship, and he kind of looks at me, and he is like, \"Why?\" I was like, \"My parents needed their citizenship, and I have a lot of family that did, and it was really,\" Brianna's face, Brianna's face, and by the way, this was not a white man. This was someone who was very clearly second generation, and I was explaining to him why. He goes, \"Yeah, but my parents did it.\" Again, this is a college interview. I was like, \"This is not where we're supposed to be having this issue. I was just telling you about what I do in my free time.\" He was like, \"No,\" and he's a doctor, by the way, who graduated from Georgetown. Yeah, it was Georgetown. He was like, \"Well, my parents figured it out, and so I'm sure they did too. Your parents probably figured it out. They did it without programs like yours.\" I was like, \"Yeah, barely. They barely did it, and they were pretty well off, all things considered, so let's consider the people that aren't well off.\" And so, it was the most conversation I had had about this, because I think, Jessie, you kind of hit the nail on the head. It's like people start with this empathy, and then they kind of do it, and there's slowly this ideological shift, where they're like, \"Well, I did it by myself, so you should do it by yourself too.\" It's kind of like how people were so against student loan forgiveness, because they paid off their own student loans. I was like, \"That's crazy.\" It's kind of like a sinking ship mentality, like take everyone down with me. I don't know. I think it's one of the most frustrating things about current American politics, where there's this very individualistic view of what a person should be able to do for themselves, but the issue is A, that's harming everyone else around them, and B, it's harming people who had no say in the decision, like kids who couldn't afford lunch, and they're also not supposed to be working full-time jobs. Why are we punishing them? I mean, I would go so far as to say, why are we punishing their parents too? But even on a base level, why are we punishing them? It's crazy to me. It's obscene.

I think it's not surprising whatsoever that, generally, people who are richer are more conservative. I think that's a pretty consistent trend. I don't think that's a new thing and, in general, it is hard to try and get that into someone, because the flip side of that is that people have justified pride in their own accomplishments. I think part of that is that making that easier for other people, or creating more resources and such, kind of a little bit diminishes that idea, just from what I've seen like, \"Oh, I did it, because it was hard.

But for me, personally, I don't appreciate doing that. I think, I mean, it can be misinformation, not that I think this is, but I think that it's just a little bit harder to tell on social media platforms and things like that, what someone's motivation is, so just making it clear what the point is.

Are you using this to advertise the documentary?\" And so, I looked up what the actual documentary was, and it isn't entirely about food insecurity. It's about poverty and surrounding issues in the United States, in which case I don't think that this is a good representation of all of that, because I assume they would probably try and give a bit of every perspective. I can't imagine you have a 60-minute documentary about poverty and surrounding issues, and only talk to two kids, so it's not good at that. I think what you said about this being for Instagram, it's probably the most accurate thing, in which case, it's kind of strange, because on the one hand, if the purpose of the video is to direct people to the longer video and draw people in, like a trailer, that's obviously failed at doing that. Also, because you can't click the link. It doesn't go to the right link. But we already talked, I think, a lot about the potential education value of something like this, and there isn't much. I mean, I think the one good thing about it maybe is just in the sense of general humanization. That's fair. I can get behind that. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, anyway, and if it was on an Instagram reel, people would probably just scroll away, because, yeah, I also generally dislike sort of, \"Ooh, attention grabbing news,\" type things that have cropped up. This isn't that. This is kind of just a person talking for a long time, by short form content standards. I don't think this video is particularly good at achieving its goals if those were the two goals that I was able to identify. Generally, I mean, I think they should have gone for one of them.

Even though we talked about, it does open more questions than it answers, it doesn't actually inspire us to seek out the answers to those questions.

Because I think instilling the right mindset in younger generations is going to break that stigma of whatever the opposite, like what we were saying before, we can't think of anybody that thinks child poverty is good. Even if there is out there that we just haven't, I guess, come across yet, this would be breaking that stigma. I think there's a lot of stigma around this, so that would be starting with the kids. So just kind of seeing what are these kids, the younger kids, thinking that aren't receiving this, and then, also talking to adults, again, that think on the opposite end that, \"My money shouldn't be going towards this,\" and just, while it's going to be uncomfortable to hear it for us, but it would be nice to hear it.

I don't know if any of you have heard of it. That happened, and I remember it very vividly. Because I had teachers leave class. I wasn't at Saugus, it was somewhere else, but teachers left class because their kids went to that school. Afterwards it was reported that the Saugus shooting was a ghost gun. So the kid didn't buy it from anywhere. He bought a kit online and he assembled it and he killed two people and then himself. I thought that was also interesting because the NRA didn't take a position on that and they were like, oh, guns. Second amendment. I was like, this is weird. I feel like this is a point where you should be making some advocacy, but they just treated it like it was exactly the same. So I think that's also interesting.

He's more like the NRA into the slogans of the topic, even though it's a very serious thing and you really don't want to do that.

It's interesting because I'm from California, so a lot of people here are very anti-gun, but I'm also from Los Angeles where gun violence is a huge thing and gang violence is a huge thing. And the high school I went to, multiple times people would bring guns to school and then get arrested. It was really scary first of all, but also just it became normal. I literally saw someone get arrested in front of me because he had a gun in his bag, and I was just like, \"Okay, I'm going to go to class,\" which is really upsetting. So, thinking about conversations I've had with other people, a lot of the time I would say, we have to agree on this is something that shouldn't be happening. We should not be bringing guns to this high school campus and just generally we need better regulation on guns. But I do think it's also frustrating, or more an interesting perspective, because there are a lot of young adults and teenagers here who think that they need a gun for personal survival almost. And I don't know because I've never lived that life, so I can't necessarily say that they're wrong. It's definitely a perspective I don't hear a lot of people talk about. I mean, of course it facilitates more violence, but I think it's something so unique to hear that a lot of people don't really think about because a lot of the times talking about school shootings, a lot of them bring assault rifles and things like that, but a lot of the gun violence here is handguns, things that are very unlikely to be taken away.

But I think that the possibility of taking away handguns or just glickies, are just very unlikely. And I think that those are less likely to cause, not school shootings or just massive examples of gun violence than assault weapons are.

I can start. I like what Noah brought up about the Matthew McConaughey meeting with the victim of the shooting. I didn't know that he did that. It's a really great thing to do and I think it's a good thing to have people watch together, because it's a positive thing to watch after such a tragedy happening. It's a positive something that might give people hope. If we don't have any reactions right now, we can move on to the feedback portion. Now we'll think about giving just direct feedback to the makers of this clip. Say whatever you guys think. No filter or anything. Whatever you guys, whatever think you think is helpful to know would be great. We'll start off with, if you saw this video on your own, would you have kept watching or was there something about it that might've turned you away and maybe turned it off halfway through or not really watch too much of it?",

So that we can focus our efforts on, instead of a scattershot approach to let's just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks, we have a more precise idea of where to grow stuff to know that somewhere in this area it's more likely to stick, would be very helpful. And the person that looked like they might be able to do that on this list is Doug Riggs, the Northwest policy advocate. As a policy advocate guy, that's a polite term for a lobbyist. That's kind of what it is. And so if there's anybody that's really going to understand how to pull, how to pull the levers of power and get things to move in certain directions, that's your guy. It's not the political leaders themselves that really have the best understanding of how to pull the levers of power because they are the lever that's being pulled. It's who's doing the lever pulling that you want to really ask, how do we get things to move? Does that make sense? Would you agree with that?

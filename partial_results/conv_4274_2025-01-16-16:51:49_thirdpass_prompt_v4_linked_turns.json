    "words": "Cool. Okay, cool. So I think that is all I need to say about that. So let's play this game, and whenever you need to jump out, it's like any game, so you can kind of leave whenever. So the way that the game is played is by interacting with these image cards. These image cards are actually generated by AI based on different values of different students. Yeah, yeah. That's your hand, so you can take a look. You don't have to show anyone your cards, and the goal of the game is to use these cards to tell stories and to encourage each other to tell stories. So the game will start like this. There'll be one storyteller denoted by the storyteller token. So let's say I'm the storyteller first and I hold the token. I get to pick one story thread to start my story. There's a level one card, a level two card, and a level three card, and they just differ on how deep or how complex, or how you'll see the difference. So let's say I choose level one. This card says, \"The aha moment where everything just clicked.\" I'm going to look in my hand and find an image card that in any way represents what I'm feeling about this card. So I have these cards, which I'll just show you just because kind of like templing, and maybe I would pick something, I don't know, maybe something like this. I feel like when I came to... I'm not at all someone who would associate myself with... Hello. Thank you. Come have a seat. I'm just explaining how to play the game. We're sitting down to talk about our values and some things that we care about, about education, and... Oh, thank you so much.",

So right now, that storyteller is me, and so when I pick up a card, which you pick from these story thread piles, you look in your hand and you try to match a card to the story that you kind of have in mind, and it's going to be really loose because the cards are really ridiculous, so don't try too hard to make it perfect. So yeah, so something like when I came to MIT, I really didn't associate myself with just generally a science and working in a lab kind of person. I kind of more was almost maybe more... I don't know, I don't quite have a card. Maybe more chaos or more like dancy embodied, but I think at one point in my education I did have this clicking moment because it was like here, in this lab, people learn from each other all the time and I'm like, oh, this is the way to learn. I could go on and tell that story. So that would be an example of a way to use this to tell a story. After that, all of you now have the chance to play one of your cards, so if any of your cards is similar to this card, you can look down and play it. I don't know if I have a different deck of cards. Maybe you'd be like, \"Oh, this one is very similar,\" and once you do that, you have the option of either bridging or tunneling. A bridge is this white token here, and a tunnel is the black token. So if your story relates and you'd like to share your own story that's similar, maybe you say, \"I also had this feeling as well all these TVs everywhere,\" something like that. You would bridge between these two and then this would create a thread. If you had, were interested in my story and you want me to go deeper, you use the tunnel card. So you could say something like, \"What were you doing before MIT that got you to that position? Was it something like this?\" And you could use this card to kind of formulate that question. Again, use the cards kind of broadly. There's no real right or wrong to it. Does that kind of make sense?",

There's a subject that I hated in undergrad, which was statistics because it really felt like just a set of tools that I had to apply. I was like, \"Why does it matter at all?\" But then I started to find the beauty in statistics, even though beforehand I was shown what type of things it could come from, and so I think I'm more of a meta level. There is this idea of us having or us as humanity having built this concept from practice. So algebra and geometry came from philosophers and mathematicians 2,000 years ago looking at it on this end, on the size of not a computer, but measuring things and realizing that these things could be represented in an abstract manner, in a way that was allowing us to do much more than what we could do with our physical life, and also created this system of very coherent knowledge that it is very relaxing to me because of how much we can... I'm kind going in all the directions, but there is really this kind of meta idea of us having an abstraction of reality that is extremely simple and elegant in a way, and that is representing a really hard complexity with a few axioms. The specificity of having that, just a set of axioms that this whole universe of rule, and objects that interact with one another in a way that is actually relevant back to our sentient life, which is something that I found quite incredible and how far math led us in terms of physics as emerging from us being capable of having more and more sophisticated representation of the complexity of human life and nature. Nature much more. I did my PhD in trying to model human behaviors, and we are really at the infancy of such fields. So that was the one, I think, and also, there's this feeling of not having... We know that something is true, which is very frustrating, I think, for when we with actually human because we don't know that much what is true and what is not true, but it's a field where you have axioms, and you can prove things. There's something I found really relaxing to know that I know when something is true, even though this can have limits, of course. Now, I'm limited here, and that are cultural, but when they are, this feeling of knowing that something is true is something I find fascinating.",

I feel like that was kind of lacking in my education, before my PhD. I've now come to seek it out more intentionally. I don't know if that's more of a lack of ethics of the people in charge of my education. Maybe it's more of a lack of forethought or something, but yeah, I think that was, and so I chose this labyrinth because I think creating technology is like you're kind of navigating a labyrinth of the real world and different people that are going to be using it, and the different impacts that it's going to have out in the real world.

So I just think it's like that everywhere, but at least I knew that when I would be done with my PhD, I could do a lot of... The level of freedom I would get to would be massive. I could choose which project I work with, and if I don't want to work with that person, well I would not work with that person because now I'm my own researcher and I can decide if I make a project with this person or not, but that was a tough moment.",

It was the more time you spend plotting, scheming, networking, getting money, going on media, getting interview, the less time you can actually do research because we have 24 hours per day. So if you spend 70% of your time trying to work on administrative things and recruiting people or firing people or whatever, well you don't read books and you don't dig with the data, and so I realized that actually the more powerful people were powerful in the other position within the academic capital. But when you talk to them about the topic, they knew very little about it. They were, \"Oh, I read that in the Washington Post.\" Okay, cool. And then I realized that there was something that was the persistence effect. When the star dies, you can still see the light of the star, even though the star is actually dead, and I think that's what happened in academia as well. People publish very important papers and book when they're actually young, and they're starting their career and they have to get a job, and they are still working a lot, and then because people still see the star of what they published 20 years ago, they still think, \"Oh, they are up-to-date with whatever is going on,\" but actually, a lot of people don't do that anymore. They publish their thing, and now it's done, and they have no idea what's going on. Maybe it's not the truth in those fields, but in political science it's very much true, and I always thought that the younger researcher were a bit more curious and interested, and still a freshness to them.",

So for instance, if you take a city, you can hire people that are supporting with your campaign and you can fire people that are not, and I think precisely... I come from a country where research is mainly publicly sponsored in France, but it was interesting to see, for instance, during the debate on Israel-Palestine in Harvard. There were donors that were like, \"Oh, you said stuff I don't like them, therefore, my money will not come to me anymore,\" and for me, that's incredibly dangerous because then it means that at some point you would not be able to criticize a billionaire because they are the ones sponsoring the research. Yeah, and then the same stuff. If actually in order to get money to hire people you need to spend so much of your time doing just getting grants, then you don't do research anymore, and then you become something else. You're no longer a researcher for research and science. You're a researcher of money, which is a different type of research, I guess, and that means that it's also a different-type set of skills that it requires. So it's a bit stupid that you wasted all those years learning about the human body, or AI, or democracy because now the only thing you're doing is learning how to get money, but then precisely in term of connecting with the power things, that gives you so much power because you decide who gets in, who gets out. So I would be more in favor of a system where it's more public on the one hand, and on the other hand, there would be grounds for any level of research. It's the case in Switzerland. I got a grant from Switzerland and they have grants for PhD. They have grants for postdocs. They have grants for early care researchers. They have grants for others. So anybody can apply. I don't need to ask the permission from a guy that's been there for 50 years to... I don't need the support. I can apply for my own project and because it's my project, well, that's my topic, and then they give me the grant or they don't, but I think that's a better model, but I didn't conduct extensive...

And then I realized that I don't know in term of quantities, but one of the logic was... and I was trained in the Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu in Sociology of Social Reproduction, how an institution or a group reproduces itself. For a theory for a professor, it's important that he can reproduce the theory or the paradigm it's working on. If you're like a holist, Durkheimian sociologist, well, you want to hire people and train people that are going to be holist, their kind of people. Anytime you arrive to a problem, it's like, \"Okay, how can I invent that problem so it fits the frame of being a holist Durkheimian?\" Therefore, it's not so much being open to being wrong or being open to finding something unexpected. It's more like confirming what you already know. It's like confirmation bias, and you're going to judge the other people, especially the people you are going to recruit and train, based on how well they're going to agree with your paradigm or not, and therefore, if you don't look like that, then I guess they put you here or there because you're weird for them. Yeah, that was also something. There is stuff in the research that I like, but those two questions.",

It was like, \"Oh, this industry, and I'm so proud of people in the industry,\" and was like, \"France wouldn't call it an industry. For us, it's art. It's like certain arts, and for them this was like, \"It's business. It's an industry,\" and I think that's the tension is like you try to do art or we try to show knowledge and truth, but at the same time we need to make money and there are people that are artists. So I think the tension between art and industry is something. I guess in the US for the fact that because of the tuition fees are so expensive, it's kind of an industry as well, getting people to go into college and university, and taking money from them, and then they have to get student loans, and it's also a whole thing, and you don't want to offend them, so therefore, you're like, \"[inaudible] I'm not sorry.

Oh, my god, and there's waves,\" and you just start to tell stories with it, and I thought that was a really good use of AI because, right now, AI is not great at being super accurate, and people are like, \"Really? How can you be more accurate?\" And I'm like, I think it's wild. It's adding wild things. This is really one of my favorite cards. I think it's so interesting how that one came to be, and it was from a description of someone at the Media Lab to describe their group, interestingly, and it brought in other things into the image, which it was so cool hearing you say those things that I was like, \"The AI didn't mean to do that. The person who made this card didn't mean to do that,\" but now that you're saying it, I'm like, \"Oh, I relate so heavily.\" I just think that that is the kind of experience I want to make in games that it's really about finding group intelligence, and that to me speaks to very interesting agency.",

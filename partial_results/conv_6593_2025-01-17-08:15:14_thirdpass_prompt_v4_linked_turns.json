This one, basically, there's the academic, the professional. And then I don't know what this guy is here. This could be more domestic here. That's what I kind of noticed, though. As for how it resonates with what we heard? I don't really know. I mean, other than that, these are obvious different aspects of the city. Different worlds. Certainly alienation. Isolation could be there. Haves and have-nots, and different populations. And then finally, what questions? Well, clearly, the question of what is really going on? But, yeah, I mean, to me, I guess the question for me would be, is it a choice between one or the other? Or can we have, as a lot of people like to have their cake and eat it, too, can we be a yuppie and be compassionate? Can we be on campus and care about what's happening on the ground level type of thing? I don't know if that's what's going on. That's kind of how it struck me.",

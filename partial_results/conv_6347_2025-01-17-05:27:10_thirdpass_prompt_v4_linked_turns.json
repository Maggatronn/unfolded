    "words": "Okay, so really going over once again, reiterating the purpose of the conversation. Really just building constructive listening space. So really want you to share from your personal stories. So think about your own lives, your own experiences, rather than maybe something you heard, or rather just your own position. It's really just more about build off of your experience, right? So stick to your story, your truth. Then I also want, again, to reiterate what's going to happen to this recording. So after this meeting, after this conversation, I'm going to upload the audio recording to a database called Fora, which MIT uses to create a transcript. So the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, I'm going to refer to it as CCC if you get confused, and so they go ahead and go in, look at the data and everything. It's really an effort to create a conversation platform. The Fora system creates the transcript of every recorded conversation, uses highlight keywords, and then allows also us to search the conversation, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. Really what we want to accomplish today is to begin the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston team in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected, and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risk. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. We will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. And then do you consent to this? And if everyone can just say, I agree.",

    "words": "Sweets. Okay, cool. So I'm going to verbally explain how the rules go. So basically this is a game about listening. It's also a game about missing, or sorry, about unveiling missed realities. So we're going to have a conversation and through understanding one another and playing the game, we're hopefully going to find something usually unsaid. The way that we're going to do that is by working our way through the board, each of you will take turns answering something about this central theme, and that's how we'll understand it. In addition, there's another player in the game, the AI. And the AI is going to help or hurt by visualizing what you all agree in is said in a conversation or what is known about the topic. And so the way that it does that is it takes conceptual words that we say. So you can enter any type of words to get in this image, and you will all work together to create the image. So in this example, any of these things could be said. So it could be something like super visual, like a crowd of people around people, whatever. It could be something specific. And what the model will do, is it will turn that into a visual thing, combine them and make an image. The only things you can't enter are profanity and names of artists, specific artists, that will get flagged by the system, but otherwise you can add whatever words you want. And so doing that together, the image is going to reflect something if you do it kind of in a certain way. But to help you with that process of making an image as a group and having it relate to the topic, each of you will play different roles. So the first role, and everyone will have a different one. It's not just you, we'll rotate, but the first role is kind of the most important, and that's the storyteller. So that person is going to answer some type of story about that second question, and they can say whatever they want in a period of time, denoted by the timer. So they just get to speak. You're encouraged to speak personal stories and honest stories and things that are true to your experience are helpful. The other roles will listen and write down things. So they're the ones who are creating the images with words. And so those roles are, describe the fool and the empath. Describe is the visual things, the literal. So what is literally happening in that story? So if I was telling a story about me running this test in C3, you might be like, \"Oh, we were in this white bubble,\" and that could be really important. Or you can also kind of be creative about it and be like, the bubble didn't really matter. It was all about being really playful. And you can add games. So whatever specific details you want to add, you can. The opposite is the empath. The empath is doing the conceptual ideas like the moods and the feelings. And the empath is also denoted by the image of the snake for a reason, because the snake is looking for the hidden. Okay, you're slithering through and finding what is this person really feeling about the story?",

    "words": "You can be cheeky. It's good. So yeah, so that person is looking for not necessarily what the person is saying, but what they're really meaning. And so it's your job to represent what is really meant in this story. The last role is the fool. And the fool is the wild card. And so you're listening for the story, for what is the aspect of the story that's really fun? What is the emphasis of the story? What is the thing that's like, okay, sure, you're saying all these things, but really what is the symbol that's going to represent what is a meaningful thing in this story? And so to help you decide as these roles what to write, you can ask each other questions. So once the storyteller is done telling the story, you can ask whatever question you want. For example, if they didn't go into any specific detail about where it was, you could ask questions like, well, where was that happening? Or if they kept it surface level, you could probe deeper if you're the empath, or if you're the fool asking questions, what was really important to you? Or did you find this to be particularly funny? Those kinds of things. And so by doing all of that and acting within your roles, that's how you create the center image. That center image, the AI will also give you a description of how it combined the words that you all wrote in to make the image as well. Once you get the image, you can then as a group reflect on what in the image made sense, what you put, how you see it, things like this. Because at the end, you're going to be asked a question. All of you will have made an image yourself and given it a title. And then at the end, the AI is going to combine all of that information to make one single image. And if you've been paying attention to what the model is doing and to what the words you've been using are, then you can take a good guess at what it's going to be. And you collectively win the game if you are able to guess what the middle object, the middle picture will contain.",

And then there was a back living room that was kind of small and cramped and didn't have good airflow. I thought my expectation for that room was that we would spend time together and really deepening our relationship and deepening our understanding of each other. And lastly, there was a really cute little balcony, and I loved to be out on that balcony in the summer. And my expectations for that space were that we would enjoy sharing stories out there and having meals and romantic dinners in the horizon. And my partner ended up not enjoying cooking in the way that I anticipated or that he thought he expressed previously. So I ended up doing mostly cooking or we would get takeout probably too much, too often. But yeah, it was a paradox reality of fantasy and disappointment, I would say. Yeah.",

And so I am happy for those things to be used, because they're meant to be used. And I think it makes cooking a much nicer experience. But I am frustrated if I have set some expectations of, okay, don't wash the knives in the dishwasher, because it dulls them and then find them in the dishwasher more than once. I understand it's a mistake, I'll say something and leave it, but if it happens again, I will get annoyed and if it keeps happening, I will probably just take my things back. But it's never gotten to that point. And because of that, I've felt very comfortable putting all of my belongings out into a communal space and never have had any issues with people taking things or keeping things or mistreating them. And yeah, I feel like it makes me happy if people are also able to get value out of the things that I have added to a communal space, because it means I've added a worthwhile piece to the community and it's not just a thing that only I use, that sits in the corner.

Pretty much anything that involves putting something back after using it. A challenging dynamic is he would eat everyone's food, but when confronted, he would not admit to it. One time I had frozen blueberries in the freezer and they were the only blueberries in there. And I come downstairs at 10:00 AM and the white fridge handle is just full of blueberry hand prints and there's no other blueberries, but mine. And he still said that it wasn't him. It's a challenging dynamic, because maybe a little conflict averse, but a driver of conflict, just thinking everything is shared, which ideally it would be, but overtaking his share of things.

And also wonder if you could somehow lean, like you said, well, you're working on the UI and the way the interface works, if you can lean into that even a bit more, I don't know, it's very storytelling. I think there's a really interesting connection there. And I was also thinking because, and this is maybe because I know a bit too much, but I thought the questions aspect of it was also really nice, because if someone tells a story, you ask questions, that's actually when a lot of the connection happens. So I was wondering maybe there would be a way that you could really make it more of a part of the game design. So now it's more kind of a suggestion that you can ask questions, but I don't know, maybe you can ask at least one per person or you prompt every round, one person has to, I don't know, there's probably multiple ways of doing that, but I felt that was a really nice aspect of the design.",

So one other thing that I thought connected to the world that could be interesting is somehow, actually Christina asked this also, how do you prompt, for instance, an emotional thing? And I think that's a really cool thing, because you're describing the story from different angles. So I am also wondering that could be something if you think that's interesting that you could also add more in the interface or in the way that the game sort of accompanies that you're learning how to prompt in an emotional way or in a funny way or in a, yeah, I thought that was pretty cool also, and we talked about this, again, I know too much. So one thing that we talked about before was the idea of trying to beat the AI, which you said it's not a good idea and I understand why. I am wondering if you can introduce some sort of time limit or race against a clock or something like that. And I had to think of Pandemic, do you know Pandemic? It's also this game where you work together and you try to beat a pandemic. This is before the pandemic, but it's a really good game. And I don't know, there's a mechanic in there where there's an epidemic and after three epidemics you just lose the game. So I don't think it's about winning and losing, but I do think it could be interesting to think about that a bit more. How do you push people to want to win and to want to do the next round or I think that could be interesting too.",

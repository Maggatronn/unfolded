But I do find it very comfortable to meet and talk to other performers and people who are familiar with either playing an instrument for a group of people, dancing in front of people, creating art, and then being vulnerable and just putting something that they worked out for other people to see, because a very difficult thing to do. And I think it's valuable when people do that. I played the cello several, several years, and then I came here and I danced for several years and then I've been doing art my whole life.

How do you have long-distance relationships, open relationships, those kind of conversations. And I find it just so, we're actually talking about something real, that feels like a really real conversation to me. And it feels, to let someone open up to you about their relationship is really meaningful to me. I'm like, oh wow, that's a really vulnerable thing to talk about, but feels really good because maintaining relationships is so difficult.

I was super shy and I was very like, oh, I need to conform to make a lot of friends. And then it is better if I don't say anything and speak when I just know something is funny or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then I would always burn myself out every semester trying to commit to these things that I thought would make me happy. And they were fun, all the bananas are smiling, it'll be fun to go hang out with these bananas. But then I realized, wow, I'm really burning myself out and overexerting myself trying to hang out with people that I just kind of like. And so eventually I realized that there's people at MIT that I like on a different level, that I'm like, I so genuinely want to spend time with you. It is an active decision for me because all the time that I do not spend hanging out with friends is either spending time for myself, whether I'm gaming or I'm reading or doing something that I like, or it's for my own development, whether I'm learning a skill, doing my homework, looking at opportunities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so this card matches the most my social life at MIT, it is always a fun time, but then you really have to discern who are the people amongst the bananas. And I think social life at MIT is really a variable for a lot of people, because I've met people who are like, how did you even find so many events that you got burned out? And then I'm like, \"How do you not? There's always so much happening on campus all the time.\" And then I realized, oh, there's so many different social lives happening at MIT.

But overall, I sort of figured out I'm okay, a group of friends I want to put most of my time towards. And I don't really feel the need to be friends with every single person I meet. But also I think generally at MIT, I've known some students who are in their room 24/7, they never interact with anybody else. And I've heard some people are like, how do you not have friends at this point? I think friendships can be hard for people to make. And sometimes I think friend groups often, sometimes they explode because some sort of drama that you end up not having any friends or I don't know. I think, what's it called? It's really easy to feel alone at MIT sometimes. And I think not having that great of a social life or somewhere to fall back on is not the best environment to be in.",

And it really interesting because while I didn't do my undergrad here, but my perception of the grads is I am talking to a new person every time. I'm just like, \"Is this the same school?\" Really, it's such variable experiences. And when I moved to Cambridge, really had that experience as well. So outside of MIT, I think it's really similar. And I came here and I was like, \"Where's the stuff? Nothing is going on. I'm so bored.\" And obviously you move somewhere and it's difficult to get to know people, but I think because where I had come from, the way that people bond is way different. I was living in Montreal before and that city is so different, it's cool. It's really cool. People there, they don't really need to work, right? Social life isn't oriented work. Boston, the entire city of Boston, it is like work is a joy. So I was missing, and now I'm in the situation that I'm like, okay, there's actually way too much going on and I need to set boundaries again. But it's crazy that this is the same place with the same amount of things going on. And at first I felt like that, and now I feel like this. So things can change so radically. Another thing that you said that I really liked too is I'll never forget where you said this, I'll think about this card every time, you got to know the people from the bananas. Oh my God, there's a time in your life. And it's exactly this time, it's exactly moving through the course of being first year undergrad through to the end because you want to be friends with everyone because you're like, \"Ooh, maybe, who knows what this is?\" You're exploring. And then it's so awkward to put up walls, it's so harsh, it's against my whole philosophy of getting to you. But that's good, it's good to put up boundaries, it's tough.",

So it's a reflection rather than a dialogue, where it's like right now we're dialoguing, but therapists are just trying to get you to hear you, which is such a weird thing to think about. But I really like that idea because it's like I think through dialogue so much, I think I start to understand things only by speaking. And even though it's the same thought, I'll be lying in my bed being like, oh yeah, I should make this game, whatever. And then I'll go and I'll talk to Will and we'll be talking, and then I'm like, now I understand. But it's only when I articulated it to someone do I even understand it myself. And so my question on, yeah, maybe we don't need to theorize each other or open up or anything, but if you don't open up to anybody, then can you really understand yourself? Or do you really have this relationship where you're thinking as much? You know what I mean? So isn't it a nice way to also just be in the world? Maybe it's not about vulnerability or not, but it's just about let's go toe-to-toe on something. Let's play with words. Yeah, that's what I like about it, but I appreciate your story as well. But the one I wanted to pick was this one, I really liked this. I was waiting for the band, as I said, and I think that it's a sentiment that I hadn't heard articulated that way, but I think, again, learning through dialogue, something just clicked in my brain a bit there. I was like, yeah, there is this one day thing that happens that you need to become good at establishing beyond trees. And it's not offensive at all. Everybody's awesome in this picture, you said everybody's a great crowd. It's just, yeah, either comes a time that you just need to not talk to the crowd, you need to be into it, a fewer friends. And that process doesn't need to be bad, it doesn't need to be offensive. It's not rejection, this is not rejection. This person is in a crowd of people that's like... It's still all great, it's just like my side of the parade, I'm going to stay here. It's commitment. I thought that was interesting to share. Cool. Well, thank you all very much.

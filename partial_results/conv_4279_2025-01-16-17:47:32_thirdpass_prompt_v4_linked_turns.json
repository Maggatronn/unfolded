    "words": "Hello, hello, hello. Cool. Okay, cool. So yeah, I think that is all I need to say about that. So yeah, let's play this game and whenever you need to jump out, it's like any game, so you can kind of leave whenever. So the way that the game is played is by interacting with these image cards. These image cards are actually generated by AI based on different values of different students. Yeah, yeah, that's your hand, so you can take a look. You don't have to show anyone your cards. And the goal of the game is to use these cards to tell stories and to encourage each other to tell stories. So the game will start like this. There'll be one storyteller denoted by the storyteller token. So let's say I'm the storyteller first and I hold the token, I get to pick one story thread to start my story. So there's a level one card, a level two card, and a level three card, and they just differ on how deep or how complex or how... You'll see the difference. So let's say I choose level one, this card says, \"The aha moment where everything just clicked.\" I'm going to look in my hand and find an image card that in any way represents what I'm feeling about this card. So I have these cards, which I'll just show you because kind of like templing, and maybe I would pick something like, I don't know, maybe something like this. I feel like when I came to... I'm not at all someone who would associate myself with... Hello. Thank you. Come have a seat. I'm just explaining how to play the game. We're sitting down to talk about our values and some things that we care about, about education and... Oh, thank you so much. I think it's connected now. And we're using the game to play. So I'm going to deal you in. The game starts by assigning a storyteller who I'm just demoing. So right now that storyteller is me. And so when I pick up a card, which you pick from these story thread piles, you look in your hand and you try to match a card to the story that you kind of have in mind. And it's going to be really loose because the cards are really ridiculous, so don't try too hard to make it perfect. So yeah, so something like, when I came to MIT I really didn't associate myself with just generally a science and working in a lab kind of person, I kind of more was almost maybe more, I don't know, don't quite have a card, maybe more chaos or more like dance-y embodied. But I think at one point in my education I did have this clicking moment because it was like here in this lab people learn from each other all the time, and I'm like, \"Oh, this is the way I like to learn.\" Anyway, I could go on and tell that story. So that would be an example of a way to use this to tell a story. After that, all of you now have the chance to play one of your cards. So if any of your cards is similar to this card, you can look down and play it. So maybe I don't know if I have different type of cards. Maybe you'd be like, \"Oh, this one is very similar.\" And once you do that, you have the option of either bridging or tunneling. A bridge is this white token here, and a tunnel is the black token. So if your story relates and you'd like to share your own story that's similar, maybe you say, \"I also had this feeling as well all these TVs everywhere,\" something like that. You would bridge between these two, and then this would create a thread. If you were interested in my story and you want me to go deeper, you use the tunnel card. So you could say something like, \"What were you doing before MIT that got you to that position? Was it something like this?\" And you could use this card to kind of formulate that question. Again, use the cards kind of broadly. There's no real right or wrong to it. Does that kind of make sense?",

So why don't we go with you first since you're maybe shorter on time. So I'll move the storyteller token to you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Let's do a warmup first so we can all introduce each other and each other's names. So the warmup for this round is pick the image card in your hand which best represents how your body is feeling right now. Point to the part of the image that demonstrates this feeling and pass left when you're finished speaking. Maybe I'll pass to you and then we'll go that way and then we'll begin the proper rounds.",

I was like, \"Why does it matter at all?\" But then I started to find the beauty in statistics, even that I was beforehand, I was shown what type of things it could come from. And so I think on more of a meta level there is this idea of us as humanity having built this concept from practice. So algebra and geometry came from philosophers and mathematicians looking on this end, on the size of, not a computer, but measuring things and realizing that these things could be represented in an abstract manner, in a way that was allowing us to do much more than what we could do with our physical life. And also created this system of very coherent knowledge that it is very relaxing to me because of how much we can... I'm kind going in all the directions, but there is really this kind of meta idea of us having an abstraction of reality that is extremely simple and elegant in a way, and that is representing a really hard complexity in an essence with a few axioms. This could be this idea of having just a set of axioms that end up creating this whole universe of rules and objects that interact with one another in a way that is actually relevant back to our stent in life, which is something that I found quite incredible. And how far math led us in terms of physics as being emerging from us being capable of having more and more sophisticated representation of the complexity of human life and nature. Making nature much more. I didn't to model human behaviors and we are really at the infancy of such fields. So that was the one, I think. And also there's this relaxing feeling of not having... We know that something is true, which is very frustrating I think for when we work with actually human, because we don't know that much what is true and what is not true, but it's a field where you have axioms and you can prove things. And there's something I found really relaxing to know that I know when something is true, even though this can have limits, of course, that are affirmative. But when they are, you have this feeling of knowing that something is true, something I find fascinating.",

But also which links with nature. And I see the bed here. Mathematics is something that really came out of studying nature, and then coming up with this sort of man made or abstraction. This abstraction that then comes from trying to understand it. And then you think about equations and you begin to invent the language in human terms. So that's the geometry that you can see now, the axioms you're talking about, but trying to synthesize it from nature. And then human beings then thinking about it and then coming up with this well-ordered system of thinking about things and how to prove them. And also seeing them then happening as you're proving that, okay, this is actually maybe how things work. So a lot of meditation there, a lot of synthesis and a lot of... What's the word? A lot of thinking about it. A lot of... Yeah. What do you think?",

I feel like that was kind of lacking in my education before my PhD. I've now come to seek it out more intentionally. I don't know if that's more of a lack of ethics of the people in charge of my education, maybe it's more of a lack of forethought or something. But yeah, I think that was... And so I chose this labyrinth because I think creating technology is like you're kind of navigating a labyrinth of the real world and different people that are going to be using it and the different impacts that it's going to have out in the real world.

And I don't know, I think when I started research I was like, \"Oh, everybody's there for the science and that's what people care about and they're there for making discovery.\" And then I just realized how far it was from the truth when you actually see people in real life and the fact that they have ego and there's going to be cases of harassment, plagiarism, data stealing. All kind of ego quarrel and like, \"Ph, I hate this person because the science is not sound. Because oh yeah, I wanted to be in this position and it took this position and therefore blah, blah, blah, and therefore all the students are shit and I'm here to work.\" And it was like the aspect of dirty politics out of it was absolutely disgusting for me. And including many people that I was working for directly and that were leading me. So that was not great. And I don't know how I managed to stay here because I'm still doing research. I think I picked it because I don't think it's that different in a lot of other fields. My brother works for a private company and he also hates his manager. And there is also like, \"Oh, this person tried to start this project and this person is very abusive to the team,\" and stuff like that. So I just think it's like that everywhere. But at least I knew that when I would be done with my PhD, the level of freedom I would get to would be massive. I could choose which project I work with, and if I don't want to work with that person, well I would not work with that person because now I'm my own researcher and I can decide if I make a project with this person or not. But that was a tough moment.",

It was like the more time you spend plotting, skimming, networking, getting money, going on media, getting interview, the less time you can actually do research, because we have 24 hours per day. So if you spend 70% of your time trying to work on administrative things and recruiting people or firing people or whatever, well you don't read books and you don't dig with the data. And so I realized that actually the more powerful people were powerful in the other position within the academic capital. But when you talk to them about the topic, they knew very little about it. They, \"Oh, I read that in Washington Post.\" Okay, cool. And then I realized that there was something that was the persistence effect. You know when the star dies, you can still see the light of the star even though the stars actually dead. And I think that's what happened in academia as well. People publish very important papers and book when they're actually young and they're starting their career and they have to get a job and they're still working a lot. And then because people think people still see the star of what they published 20 years ago, they still think, \"Oh, they're up-to-date with whatever is going on.\" But actually a lot of people don't do that anymore. They publish, they're saying it's done and they have no idea what's doing on. Maybe it's not the true in those field, but in political science it's very much true.

So for instance, if you take a city, you can hire people that are supporting your campaign and you can fire people that [inaudible]. And I think precisely, I come from a country where research is mainly publicly sponsored, in France. But it was interesting to see for instance, during the debate on Israel-Palestine in Harvard that were donors that were like, \"Oh, you said stuff I don't like, therefore my money will not come to you anymore.\" And for me, that's incredibly dangerous because then it means that at some point you would not be able to criticize billionaires because they're the ones sponsoring the research. And then the same stuff, if actually in order to get money to hire people, you need to spend so much of your time doing just getting grants, then you don't do research anymore. And then you become something else, you're not researcher for research and science, you're a researcher of money, which is a different type of research, I guess. And that means that it's also a different type set of skills that it requires. So it's a bit stupid that you wasted all those years learning about the human body or AI or democracy because now the only thing you're doing is learning how to get money. But then precisely in term of connecting with the power of things, that gives you so much power, because you decide who gets in, who gets out. And so I would be more in favor of a system where it's more public on the one hand, and on the other hand, there would be grounds for any level of research. And it's the case in Switzerland. I got a grant from Switzerland and they have grants for PhD [inaudible], they have grants for postdocs, they have grants for early care researchers, they have grants for others. So anybody can apply. I don't need to ask the permission from a guy that's been there for 50 years to... I don't need the support. I can apply for my own project, and because it's my project, well, that's my topic. And then they give me the grant or they don't. But I think that's a better model. But it's not, I didn't conduct extensive, that's my own experience.",

And then I realized that the main, once again, I don't know in term of quantities, but one of the logic was, and I was trained in the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, the sociology of social reproduction, how an institution or a group reproduces itself. And it's like for a theory or for a professor, it's important that it can reproduce the theory or the paradigm it's working on. So if you're like a holist, Durkheimian sociologist, well, you want to hire people and train people that are going to be holist, Durkheimian people. And anytime you arrive to a problem, it's like, \"Okay, how can I invent that problem?\" So it fits the frame of being a holist Durkheimian. And therefore it's not so much being open to being wrong or being open to finding something unexpected, it's more like confirming what you're original. It's like confirmation bias. And you're going to judge the other people that, especially the people you are going to recruit and train based on how well they're going to agree with your paradigm or not. And therefore, if you don't look like that, then I guess they put you here or there because you're weird for them. Yeah. That was also something.

And then they have to get student loans. And it's also a whole thing. And you don't want to offend them, so therefore you're like, \"I'm sorry.

And you can have a conversation really interestingly by being like, \"Yeah, and the house is on stilts and the stilts are also... Oh my god, and there's waves.\" And you just start to tell stories with it. And I thought that was a really good use of AI because right now AI is not great at being super accurate. And people are like, \"Really? How can you be more accurate?\" And I'm like, \"I think it's wild. It's adding wild things.\" This is really one of my favorite cards. I think it's so interesting how that one came to be, and it was from a description of someone at the media lab to describe their group interestingly. And it brought in other things into the image, which it was so cool hearing you say those things that I was like, \"The AI didn't mean to do that. The person who made this card didn't mean to do that. But now that you're saying it, I'm like, \"Oh, I relate so heavily.\" And I just think that that is the kind of experience I want to make in games, that it's really about group finding group intelligence.

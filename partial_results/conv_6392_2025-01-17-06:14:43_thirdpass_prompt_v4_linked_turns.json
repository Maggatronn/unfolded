    "words": "Okay. So first just to kind of go over again, purpose of the conversation, creating new spaces across the city to facilitate more constructive listening just across neighborhoods and communities and really building an ecosystem of listening where every community member's stories contributes to our shared understanding and building a stronger and more inclusive Boston. So really inviting you to engage in this conversation. Share from your personal stories and your own lives and experiences rather than, we sometimes do a lot of opinions or things of other people, but it's always great to stick to what you've experienced and what you know. And so this approach really aims to build connections, to facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Second, I want to address what's going to happen to the recording. So after our meeting, this is going to be part of the collection of the conversation. So this conversation, along with other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the city of Boston and it'll also be shared with the MIT Center for Contractive Communication. Thirdly, all conversations that will be a part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform. It's developed by their nonprofit organization called Cortico. So it's the MIT Center's development arm, and they have a FORA system that creates a transcript for each recording. And so we're going to upload the audio, it'll develop a transcript, and then we pull patterns and highlights from each conversation to be used for the end product. So this system allows for keywords to emerge out of different conversations. We can search the conversations, listen to audio snippets, discover patterns, and so that's really what that system uses. And then what we want to accomplish today is really beginning a process of weaving almost like a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. I have a lot to say. So this next part, we'll say verbatim. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston and transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive communication across the city. The MIT Center for Constructive Communication will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, with any conversation, there is a chance that you'll hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I'll support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. And then I'm going to ask if everyone consents to this, if you can just come off with mute and say, I agree, and then we can move forward.",

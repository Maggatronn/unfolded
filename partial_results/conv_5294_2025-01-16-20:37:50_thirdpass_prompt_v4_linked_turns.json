So since the game is about conversation and we all are pretty much strangers to one another, I thought it would be nice to start with a little bit of a warm-up. So something I do is just say your name, your affiliation to MIT, however you'd like to define that, and some surprising object in your house that you think is very, your object. So I'll go first. My name is Cassie, I'm a second-year master student here in C3, of course. And the object in my house that I feel like is totally my thing, or I bring it everywhere I go with me, even though it's inconvenient, is I have a costume box. And it's a big Tupperware box. And I used to be a dancer growing up, so I had good costumes, but now I'm the Halloween queen because every time a costume party rolls around, everyone's like, okay, come hang out at my house before, we'll have dinner and then dig through the box. And it's a box I can tell kind of annoys my roommates because it's a messy box, but it's so quintessential to me I can't possibly move without it. So that is my Cassie object. Cool. And so I'll pass it to my left.",

    "words": "Okay, good. So like I said, this is a game about, really it's about storytelling, it's about listening. But it's also about unveiling missed realities. And so you are all going to work together to discover something maybe hidden or deep. And the other trick is that an AI is going to help you uncover these things. The way that it'll work is, we'll work our way around this board, each of you will take turns telling something honest and real, putting it in the middle around a central topic. So you'll each take turns sharing something and then at the end you'll reveal something common between you all. And we're going to do that through the creation of AI images. So to help, each person is going to play a role in how you communicate with the AI. The first role is the storyteller, and the storyteller is going to be offered a question, and just respond verbally however you want. You can spend, I have a timer here which we'll use because I didn't build it into the game, but we're going to use a physical timer and it's about three minutes, so you have about three minutes to share whatever comes to mind. And you want to tell a really rich story because the other three people are all going to be listening for something in the story. Those roles are called the seer, the seeker, and the scribe. The scribe has the role of being the literal investigator, so you're the person who's listening for the visual details of the story. So if I was telling a story about my costume box, you might say a big giant overflowing box with glittery dance costumes coming out. If that was what you think was important. You could also take it more conceptual and just be like, she didn't really care about the box itself, maybe it's about the costume, and you describe the costume in detail. But either way, listen to the person's story, think about what visually should be represented, as that's going to be your job in creating an image. The seer does the inverse. So instead of thinking about the literal, they think about the conceptual. So what are the emotions or values behind it? So instead of thinking about a costume, thinking about what does the costume represent for the person. So for me it was community, excitement, being in the spotlight, silliness, those kind of words would be good to color the image that everyone else is going to make. Because really what you're doing is you're making an image together, so that would change the mood of what the scribe has described. If that makes any sense. And the seeker is denoted by this symbol, the snake, for a reason because the snake is sliding in and finding the deeper hidden meaning. And we're going to rotate roles, so it's not just you. But you will play it once, but everyone will also play it. And the snake is trying to surface those things that are hidden. So the person might talk about one thing, but really what do they really mean? Your job is to be the investigator and find out. And to help you with that, once the person has told their story, you'll have three minutes to ask as many questions as you want to fill your roles appropriately. So if the person didn't tell any details about where they were, you can maybe ask questions about, well what did it look like? Or things like this. If the person did not go into the deep questions, you can ask them, okay, well how did that really feel for you? Or how did that change your mind about something? Things like this. So ask questions earnestly to try to get to real responses because if you play your roles all well, you'll be able to generate an image. And the AI is going to take the image and take the words that everybody has used, put them together and make a description. And so that description will combine the emotional, the physical, and the deep to make the image. After it's made, the person who told the story will then reflect back on the image and give it a title based on what felt really was real about it, or just silly, or whatever felt like it was a meaningful thing to them, they can talk about it. And each of you will do that, take turns playing each role until you have a web of all of these images, leaving you with a center point. And this is where you have to see how well you've been paying attention to how the model is actually generating these images, because at the end you're going to guess what is the center image going to be. So if you've been paying attention thus far to the interpretations into how you're entering things, into how it's working, you can actually get a pretty good sense of what the middle's going to be. This is actually a horrible example because it's not actually generated, but they tend to carry similar themes. So in this case, like light or community, color, you can name these things as you get used to it. And if you correctly name what the image is going to be at the end, you win the game. Does that make sense? Cool. I'm going to be here the whole way through answering questions. So the real game, the final game would include many topics for everyone to choose from, but because it's a study, we're going to go with this one topic that I picked, which is living with roommates. As I'm sure all of you guessed. So the central question is, what does it mean to be a good roommate? You're already laughing.",

It was pretty nice, we had a large bookshelf, a bunch of toys. We were fairly young, this is until we were 10 or 12 maybe. Yeah, it was nice and very close with my sister. So it was a lot of fun growing up, I'd say we had different dynamics though back then. I was definitely the one who was more clean and organized and she was more messy and all over the place.

    "words": "So there we go. Alrighty. Welcome to the small group conversation that is a part of a joint pilot led by the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, which I'm currently working for, and FRONTLINE, which is a news company. See, this part I'm riffing. But essentially they're a news company that makes a lot of documentaries. They're very cool, and I suggest you all check them out and I'm sure we probably see them in a class at some point. Probably like history ... Or what did we do freshman year? World studies, right? That. Probably one point there. But thank you for joining this social dialogue network of voices and conversations that are happening with teens and young adults, that's us, except those of you who are 18, across the country. So I'm now going to begin recording, which I have. But I have already confirmed all of you consented to having our conversation recorded. But just for purposes again, can we have a thumbs up just to verify? Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely. Thank you. You as well. Okay. So the goal of our conversation today is to help us understand your experiences, interests, and concerns as the next generation of news consumers. We also want to better understand how FRONTLINE's documentaries impact the ways in which you see the world and one another. So to achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation. This type of conversation is centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on the issues. So this approach will essentially aim to help build relationships and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. We all good on that? Very cool. All right. So we have some quick conversation agreements. They're pretty standard. But I'll read them off. And at the end of them, if you guys could just thumbs up them, being like, \"Yeah, we get that.\" So speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Great, thank you. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time and allow others to finish speaking. Also, otherwise known as taking turns. Stay curious and ask honest questions. Pause and take time for reflection. Listen generously. So assume good intentions, while recognizing that your words do have an impact. And my favorite, try to close out any other distractions on your laptop or phones that you are paying attention to each other as much as possible. Thank you, Jack. Okay.",

So something that I find really beautiful about these documentaries, the way that FRONTLINE chooses to capture the content, is that you can obviously tell that there are two very different perspectives. Those that are obviously naturally investing in this type of technology. You're creating this type of technology. And those who are at the other end of it in which they have this view of another ... \"There's no way this could happen. And I'm currently in the position of my job potentially being taken over.\" So that's quickly to consider that we hear a wide range of opinions. And now we get to hear your opinions and just how you felt about different opinions and all of that jazz. So I'm going to begin with a few questions. We'll do one at a time and just go in a circle. It's like a graded conversation, but it's also not in the sense you're not graded. Thank you. I hate graded discussions. But the point is, once you hear a thought, just feel free to bounce off of that. It's a very free flowing conversation and I just like to hear as many voices as possible, just being mindful of balance and all of that jazz. Sound good? Great. All right. Your first question is, what is your central takeaway from this video? Now as you share, I want you guys to think about a story or an experience that might've been similar to what I shared of the documentary. It does not have to be about AI. But it may mirror the emotional or interpersonal issues that people were facing in the clip. So I can also start just to get the ball rolling. Is that okay with you guys or would someone like to jump in? I do see Kate looking for the microphone potentially? No. No. Okay, lovely. I can start then. I can't really say much about a personal experience. But generally speaking, I think that there is a concern about AI taking over a significant part of different industries. I, as all of you know, want to go into healthcare, which is a fairly recession proof industry for quite obvious reasons. But there are so many other fields and I know that a lot of you guys are going to the school of engineering or into entrepreneurship with your own individual interests. And having said that, I think that there's a lot, within the engineering field itself ... Like Karishma, I know that your dad often raves. Being like, \"Yeah, it's great for AI.\" When you tell my dad too, he's like, \"Oh, yeah, data science is great for AI.\" Because AI is essentially this brand new thing that's going to come in. And I hear this very common opinion that it's just going to take over everything and humans are going to become eternally useless, which is a terrifying thought. And so I think I was able to ... There was one moment where the guy was explaining to Mrs. Michigan, that lady whose husband was driving. And he was explaining, \"Yeah, there were already trucks on the road and they were doing X, Y, Z.\" And her face was like, \"Oh.\" And there was this ... Almost like a truth bomb or realization moment. And I think even though I'm not going into an industry with that concern per se, I could see a lot of current jobs being occupied in different industries. And so that fear I think is something that is well resonated within all kinds of different jobs. And in many ways, all of you know [inaudible]. He's a very far-sighted human. And so he's like, \"Oh, god.\" In the future they might just have machines that can do diagnoses or there are obviously already things out there that will be like, \"Give me your symptoms,\" and all of that jazz. And then will give you a big diagnosis or what your next steps should be. So I don't think it's far off in the future in which this opinion may come true per se. But I think that fear that was shared was a sentiment that could be well resonated with. All right. Does anybody- Yeah.",

Especially the night drives, they're probably not getting enough sleep. And that's actually very dangerous on the road. So technology replacing that could be good.

And you have to think about solutions for that, whether that's finding a way to train them to be in part of ... For example, they could definitely be part of the quality assurance team like the QA team at those truck driving companies. Since they have that experience, they could be educated to identify those certain driving conventions that only truck drivers with experience would know.

I think a good way that probably companies can make this better for the labor market, for making certain jobs okay and more secure, is probably implementing it in parts. I bet they're probably doing that right now. You could still have the driver there, but they can work with the AI, train it more, and they can just get it more ready. And then as time goes on, you can keep implementing more AI. And then the general business, you probably don't introduce as many jobs. But in that sense, you don't give up many educational opportunities for those jobs. And instead, offer the educational opportunities to improving AI more. It would change the field of where the labor jobs are. But at least in doing so, you're preserving jobs and giving other people those opportunities. I was also going to say ... And respect to I think a point Kate made, about seeing all AI being very important in society and taking almost all the jobs. Not like that, but being a part of every job. And I do agree that it will probably get to a point where it has some sort of influence in every job. It already right now has a lot of influence to society. Your simple Google search uses AI every single time when you're making a decision. So you're already interacting with AI every day on a daily basis. But the point I'm trying to get at here is that I don't think we'll be as fast as we think it is. Because I think right now, we're at a pretty good point where AI is flourishing and blooming. But the fields that are in charge of making sure AI is functioning in its proper are still at their lowest parts right now. But they're increasingly growing. So I think right now, we're at the beginning of something that can be much larger. So I think if you give it more time, it'll probably flourish faster. But right now, I think there's not too much tension because there's still a lot of time to be able to implement a proper system to get everything to work properly. But yeah.",

We don't have enough to do that, and it doesn't look like we're going to have enough in the near term future. We're also running out of data to train it on. There's a lot of problems with AI that need to be solved. And as you can see in the video, they terminated their fleet at the end of 2023. Obviously, that means it didn't work, it didn't take off successfully. But I don't think that means it's not ever going to be a factor. I think there's a lot of places where it can really have a lot of benefit, especially in the trucking industry, but I think that's really a long-term solution.

So when deregulation happened in the 80s, it wasn't driven by primarily by companies looking to make more profit. It was really just that the industry as a whole was unsustainable. People were just simply ... We couldn't afford to be paying people that kind of money. And over time, I think the industry of the small independent trucker, like the guy featured in the video, has really died off. And it is really a big struggle to make money in that. But there's a lot of truckers that still can make a lot of money operating as an owner operator for a larger firm. The average truck driver salary is double or triple the amount that this guy's making. And he seems like he's chill with it.

    "words": "I can resonate with the experience that self-driving cars aren't ... They're fine. I don't use technology much and I don't know how to use technology much per se, and that's my own individual flaw. But as a lot of you know, I drive to dance a few times a week and my dance classes are an hour away. So we often end up taking the Tesla just because it's more convenient. And so I often go with my mom because she'll also want to sit in or do the class or whatever. And so if we're reviewing a piece or if I'm studying to manage that one hour commute there and back, with one hour being there, one hour being back, we often go on the self-driving mode thing. And obviously, it's like jerk the wheel every few seconds. And yeah, essentially, it's do something with the wheel for a hot second, so they just know that you're being present or whatnot. And the funniest story that I have is my mom does not refer to the Tesla as a car, but a toy. The reason being that she was driving once and I was trying to turn on the Bluetooth. So I swipe up and she wasn't using her Tesla car. And so what that means is her driver profile was on my dad's. My dad's obviously got much longer legs and he winds his seat all the way back so he can just throw his arms up and drive. So I was trying to click for the Bluetooth, and then I accidentally clicked on his name instead because that's like the driver profile it was on. And my mom's seat starts going back and she's still grabbing onto it. She's yelling at me, she's freaking out on the highway because she can't reach the pedal. And we're going from a hot 75 to 40 and there are cars zooming by. She thought there was an earthquake. And then she fixed it after realizing what happened. This is now funny. And then her first course of action was to yell at me, like, \"What are you doing? Bluetooth.\" And I think that in itself is a pretty big flaw. What if my mom was a dwarf and she just wouldn't have been able to? This is not funny, but I'm being very serious in that that is not supposed to happen. Ideally, when you're driving, your drivers and speed settings shouldn't be in lock. And I think that there are small things like this that go unseen unless you really fit it with the system. And you all know that I really like to fit it with the system. But that's an anecdote that I had. And on the note of anecdotes, as I said at the start of this conversation, a big part of what the MITCCC does, which is again, the thing that I work for, is that we like to focus on conversations that are more centered around personal experience, as opposed to knowledge or opinions that we have. And I know that our style of conversation as a friend group within YI happens to be a lot about, \"Well, I feel or X, Y, Z.\" But as opposed to, \"This is something that's happened in my life,\" or a way that I'm able to personally resonate, as opposed to a more linear opinion or fact. So two things, I'd like to move on to the next question. And also, I want to try and focus the conversation as much as possible on personal experiences, anecdotes. And also, we had a very beautiful and insightful discussion with that first prompt. But if we want to be respectful of the time, I want to ask everybody to shorten their answers. If you guys are willing to carry over, that's fine and we can carry this very insightful conversation. But it's completely up to you. So how do we feel? Want to cut it as we said or whatnot? Because I know we also got a late start, which I completely take the fall for. Shorten it down a little bit? Continue?",

A lot of times, incorporating the AI provides an additional step. I personally started using the AI for helping and researching for Model UN and policy development ideas. But that was pretty much it.

So actually back in 2015 was the first real conversation I had about AI, because my dad had the opportunity to present his company's project at the time, which was a chat bot. And it was a really cool project at the time. And so I had already had experience with knowing about the cool types of things that such a tool like ChatGPT can do back in 2015. But then when OpenAI was introduced to the general public around 2022, then all these conversations started happening again with me and my dad. And I feel like I don't have much of an insight onto the other perspective of the AI debate because my dad works in data and I'm an aspiring data scientist as well. So I feel like in general, a lot of people I've talked with are on the tech side of AI, the AI debate. So I don't have that much insight into the other perspectives of it. But I'm not too heavily emotionally connected. But I will say it does make me upset when people don't realize what AI actually is. In fact, I was scrolling through Instagram the other day and I saw a reel that said, \"Oh my God, Disney is using AI.\" And it was CGI, not AI. So there's this huge misconception about AI. And I think that's what upsets me more than anything, is that when people try to debate this, they don't actually understand what AI is.",

    "words": "As someone who's probably going to most likely be an aspiring computer scientist, there's another side to AI as well. And it's related to Karishma's too. I did have a few conversations with my dad and some high school friends. My dad is an IT person at General Motors. He's been there for quite a while, but he's definitely seen a lot of changes in the job market there. For example, I think it was a few years ago, they cut off several thousands of jobs in the automotive side of that place, because they were transitioning from gas to electric. So that's one change. So I'd assume when we get more to a different place, there might be more job cutoffs as probably AI gets more centralized and stuff. But the point I was trying to get at is when you're a computer scientist, you do work a lot with coding. And there's a lot of things that you can do for AI, and there's a lot of things AI can do for you. I talked to another friend in high school and they said, \"Oh, you want to be a CS person? Oh, then imagine a few years you can just ask ChatGPT to write you a script for what you're trying to do for your programs.\" Which right now, it's not in the stages of being able to do that. It's pretty choppy. It doesn't give you the proper script. But it is a future thing that could happen. So I've had some thoughts. A little bit of fear, honestly, because there is a lot of things that AI can do with my sort of profession. But there's also a lot of things that you can do with my profession for AI, which I use as an emotional backup in a sense. What I'm trying to say is something for me to ... If I'm being held over by this other end, there's something I can do in return. For example, computer scientists are very wide in the variety of things they can do. There's a lot of different systems they can do front and back and software. And even artificial intelligence is a strand of computer science as well. So I think what I'm trying to get at is my parents are a lot in my influences in this, is that changing the way I think a bit more and trying to adapt myself so I can fit in more with the job environment. And that's what I've gone with these conversations, that you got to be prepared for what's going to happen because things are improving. And it's good for society, but you also got to be prepared for it. But yeah.",

But I think that there are so many more fields that it would impact. Like Nathan said, there's also a point in having to provide that data or being actually responsible for what the system is. And I think just getting more insight on what it's like in other industries is something. And also just like what is the current situation of it like? I think as Abni and Kate mentioned, it is a very strongly used buzzword. And so there's not a lot of knowledge about it aside from this new and upcoming fourth in Silicon Valley. And so just a little bit of clarity on what is low-key going on with AI? That's my question now. Alrighty. I think that this was fairly touched upon because all of us have had created discussions. So we tend to share our experience, bounce off in terms of what we're hearing. But let's talk a little bit about what we are hearing. So what are we hearing in people's experiences? As I said, a lot of this was about individual anecdotes. And then also, what did we see in the video? So what are we generally seeing as common themes that are coming up?",

In terms of our personal experiences, there was a wide variety depending on who you're looking at. If you're looking an example for Karishma, you can see fascination because obviously that's her field. She's excited for it. If you look at Abni and Kate when they were there, it was more of like what is the field of AI? At least what is its implications, rather what's going to happen in the future? They weren't too much on the tech type of field, so they weren't as sure. So I think we had a wide variety of those feelings.

Anything else to respond to these prompts? No? Yes? Nope. Lovely. I did think that Nathan, you brought up a really good point. Our generation has one of the lowest attention spans ever. And yes, we might be like the newer ... Generation's going to be news consumers and obviously, there's a lot going on with American politics. But even then ... Just to pull on this example in particular. Because there is very big insignificant events that's happening right now, right now. It's very flashy in terms of news. And obviously, this is something that is well aware of something that is up and coming because it's not in our faces immediately would pose such an immediate sort of consequence or even benefit. It doesn't really strike as so important. And so something to make it more interesting ... I know that a lot of the documentaries I watched middle school had really annoying music and at one point, there was a buffer of that really annoying music. And I'm like ... So I'm not saying to add Taylor Swift in the middle, but something that's a little bit more catching. This is still very documentary style and I do understand that a lot of people on the team ... And to preserve the integrity of what a documentary, is would naturally have this more slow and conversation style direction. But I do think that there is a point in which we should consider that we have so little energy and cognitive ability to really process things. So that's a point to also consider, in terms of direction and production. But okay, it is time to wrap up. Thank you so much for cooperating with this. First time figuring things out. And for sharing your questions and experiences. So as we wrap up, we can take a minute to each shout someone else in this group or something that they shared today. And so this could be anybody who was here or who wasn't here. And so I will start. And I will begin by shouting out Kate and Abni just to make it easy to knock out two people. Because I'm also at 8% and I realize the wifi is gone in this house. Or no, sorry. The power is gone in this house, but there are lights that are on because of generators. So how exciting. We love Indian internet and everything else has been working sarcastically for me today. Anyways, I would like to think Abni and Kate. I know Abni could not make it today. And Kate and Abni both are a powerhouse of intellectual ideas and knowledge and I think the thoughts they were able to contribute, really interesting. I think they were able to blend their knowledge in particular fields and personal experiences in really insightful ways. I love Kate's comment on just being a Tesla driver because I think it resonates. Obviously, I'm a Tesla driver myself and I can't say that I'm the biggest fan of it and Kate is. But I think that just goes to show the diversity within our own cohort and the varying experiences that individuals can have or even within different conversations, as Abni shared within her own friend circles and how ... Or any sort of circle really, in which conversations with AI can end up being quite generic at this point, just because there's a general area of misinformation. So I really did appreciate that they brought that up. And I think it really made me think about how one concept can be viewed in so many different ways. And also, that I'm not the only one that feels as if there's this buzzwordy sense around AI.",

I think Neha had some really insightful point of views in the sense that I know that her dad works in AI. And I think it was also nice to have a sense of neutrality in the conversation. Because as much as lived experience can obviously shape this, \"Oh my god, AI is going to drive the future of the trucking industry,\" or, \"Oh my gosh, AI is not going to take over my job\", or there might be a very rural sense to it, someone who has a fair amount of exposure to the field in general, but also has their own opinions about it. I really appreciated her sense of being neutral and being in the middle of all the different points of conversation that we had. And I think it really helped drive our conversation a lot. And as for you, Nathan, I'd never actually considered ... I honestly thought about the fact that there's someone creating all of these data models or these AI models and things. And again, I don't know much about technology, so I'm yapping here and gathering with ... I think that you put it in really great layman terms and now I'm struggling to repeat it, even though I've understood it. Karishma, I know that your job ... I think I vaguely understand that your job in the future might be providing data or gathering data to feed into AI models. And then Nathan, on the other hand, to be able to actually design those and to process them. I think it's really interesting to say that you will technically never lose your job because it is a continuous learning process. And that might be for as long as you stand as a person. Job market, all hot and ready from [inaudible]. But having said that, [inaudible], I think it was really actually interesting to hear that because you and I had ... Or I've really had a lot of delusional conversations with you being like there was smoothie and there was this robot and she took over the world. And then you're like, \"Yeah. Totally, Duthy.\" I think now I understand why you're like that can't happen. Because as much as there are self-learning models, there is going to be always some sort of human and mitigating factor. So I appreciate that insight that I never actually considered. So thank you so much, the two, for bearing with what was ... How long was this? Two hours?",

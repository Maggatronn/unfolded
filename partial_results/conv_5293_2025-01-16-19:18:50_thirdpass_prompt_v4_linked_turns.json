This is a game about conversation, so I thought it would be nice to do one of the warm-ups since we're all new to one another. So, we'll do the warm-up, same as last time, so name, your affiliation to MIT. And this time let's do the question, pick an object in your house that feels uniquely yours, something that you're like, \"Quintessential Cassie moment.\" It can also be the object that, if you move apartments right now, you're for sure bringing. I'll go first. My name is Cassie, a second-year master student here at C3. And the object that feels essentially very much mine is, I was just looking at it this morning actually, I have this costume box. It is a giant Tupperware box, like this huge. And I was a dancer growing up, so it was pretty accessible for me to start filling this thing with costumes. But now, as it's gone by, I have moved this giant Tupperware box of silly hats, glittery things, full of feathers, all of your little is come with me. And I maintain that this is an amazing item to have in your house because every party can become instantly more fun by being like, \"Why don't we just all wear wigs, huh?\" I think that that reflects me really well because my spirit is always like, \"Let's do something absolutely random. Let's do something super silly,\" and I love that it enables me to be spontaneous. And also, it is an extremely messy object, so my roommates maybe love it less, so maybe that's why I say it's quintessentially me. So, yeah, that's me. Would you like to go next?",

It's also a game about finding missed realities, so the stories that sometimes get unsaid and the emotions that we feel, but maybe don't say out loud. As a group, we're going to work together to uncover something shared and something hidden. To help you do that, there's a fifth player, and that fifth player is an AI. The AI is going to contribute by creating images. Oops. Skip this page. Yes, images. An image like this is what the AI will create, and it's going to take as input text that you write and visualize it. It's also going to do that in a particularly metaphorical way.

Okay, so as a group, you're going to all contribute a piece into the AI. So, something like this could have been a combination of words. Someone could say something like imposter syndrome. Someone could say something like feeling watched by other people. And the AI will take those concepts and visualize them. Something like imposter syndrome, the AI might interpret as looking in a mirror but not seeing yourself. Being observed by a crowd would be like endless, shapeless bodies that look on ominously. That's the kind of thing that the AI is going to contribute to this conversation. And the way that we will work together to create images is through these roles. Each role has a special job. The first role kind of the most important, and that's the storyteller. And we're all going to play different roles. Right now, it's saying you're the storyteller, but everyone will shift. The storyteller is going to respond to a question with something from their real-life experiences. That's really what the core of this is about, sharing things that have happened to you. The storyteller can pick whatever story they want to tell, and they just rant. I have this timer, and so I'm actually going to keep time, and they have all that time to fill with whatever they want to say about that topic.",

So, the storyteller is going to just roll with it. The other roles are going to be the listeners, okay, and the listeners have three types. There's the scribe, the seeker, and the seer. The scribe is the person who attends to the literal. Okay. You're going to listen for the visual details. You're going to listen for the specific things in the story, and you're going to depict those however you would like. In my story about the costume box, you might describe a massive box that overtakes a living room. It can be hyperbolic, but what is the piece of the visual that you'd like to take on? Maybe it wasn't the box that mattered, maybe it was more the sparkling costumes. You can choose, as the scribe, what piece of detail felt the most important and ultimately will make the image because that's going to be a very dominant piece of the image. On the other side, the seer is like the opposite. If the scribe does literal, the seer does abstract. You feel the mood or the tone of these things. What did I feel about my experience as a dancer growing up? Was it something exciting? Do I like mess, or am I overwhelmed by it? You could use words like overwhelmed, or excited, or scared. Those type of feelings and values-based word are going to give the image color. It will define if the characters are feeling small or very big. This role is really about the mood. You're setting the vibe. The seeker is depicted by this image of the snake for a reason. The snake is sneaking into the story and finding what's hidden. Your job is to push on the tensions. Find the thing that maybe the storyteller is saying between the text. You're listening for what are the emotions or things hidden, from the past, or what are things that this person really desires, or what does it really mean to be this person or this story? That's what the seeker is looking for. You're adding the juice to the story. Every good story needs a tension or a conflict. That's your job. To help you fulfill your roles, you listen to the storyteller, but you also get to ask questions. If the storyteller maybe didn't talk about anything visual, you could be like, \"Okay, well, where were you? What comes up in your memory?\" The seeker, if they kept it cool as a cucumber, you could be like, \"Well, what did you really feel?\" Or, \"How did that change how you saw this or that?\" You're pushing. You're asking the pushy questions. And the seer is listening for those mood questions, so use more emotion-based words of how did it feel to do that, those kinds of things. All of these instructions will be written on your phones as you encounter that role, so no need to memorize them.",

You can choose to share what you entered into the image or not, whatever helps you guys understand yourselves and the AI better. You also will get a description from the AI, as the fifth player, to describe what it included of each of yours in that picture. At the end, each of you will have done this once, creating a center point. The final step of the game is to unveil what is in the middle of all of you. A final picture will be created based on each of those stories. So, if you've been listening well and you've been paying attention to how the AI is visualizing these symbols, you can take a guess at what that final image is. In this one, it's hard to see. This is from a real session that happened. This person was vibing on this enchanted library. This person was talking about a tiny chair by a window with fairy lights. So, the final image was something kind of like in a enchanted library with fairy lights and a chair. So, you can see that the images do... and that some pieces get pulled, and so you guys, as understanders of one another, need to guess what that middle piece is. That's how the game will end.

And I had come from the University of Cambridge before, and there, basically, you sit at these long banquet halls together with other people in all sorts of different disciplines and had lots of interesting discussions. I ended up coming here thinking that we would have this shared space with lots of discussions and lots of things to do and lots of things to eat and talk together. So, I arrived and the first thing I noticed is that I didn't have a kitchen in my own three-bedroom unit. The AC did not really properly work, so it was extremely hot the whole time. I could not open the window. I was told that, somehow, you weren't allowed to open the window that much because of some kind of suicide prevention reasons, so just started feeling like a gigantic prison cell. And then, basically, what happened is the other two people were like a vastly different age. One guy moved in who was basically a former South African priest who left the church because he didn't believe in it anymore, and now was leaving South African politics to start a new master's degree. He was like 20 years older than me. And then the other person was also from a different country, very silent and not speaking much at all. Basically, yeah, it was just a bit of a total mess of, I don't know, people. It ended up not being very social at all. We also barely had a living room space. We're not really decorating anything. We just shared a few plates together. And then we had some ability to design the room, but it was also very limited in size. And I had like two suitcases that I could bring, so I didn't have much with me either. So, yeah, in the end, in terms of how it manifested in the living space, I think we kind of left it all, a pretty much at bare minimum. We didn't decorate anything together. It was literally just people staying there to study, so it was just a desk. I tried to bring in a little bit one of these wall posters from my home country.

I mean, the dorm I lived in, it's just you live in the same room, but you don't share. You don't have a kitchen, or bathroom, or anything. So, I don't... Oh, actually I do have a funny story. Okay. When I got to college, my roommate didn't have any sheets on her bed. I don't know why she didn't, and I didn't know her, so I didn't think it was appropriate to ask, necessarily. But one of my friends, who's a friend from home, who's a couple years older than me, was sending me some of her bedding because she was moving out of her dorm. She sent me a mattress topper and some bedding, and I was like, \"Oh, I don't want the bedding. I already have bedding.\" And she's like, \"I don't care. I already packed it up. I'm not unpacking it. You're getting the bedding.\" But that was perfect because she sent it and I was able to just offer it to my roommate. And I wasn't the one who broke the ice on that, actually. My friend came in. It was pretty funny. She came in, and she looked at the bed, and she was like, \"Why don't you have sheets on your bed? That's so odd.\" And then I was like, \"Actually, if you want sheets, I have some for you.\" Yeah, I guess that's not really my stuff. It was my friend's stuff, but it was sent to me. How it felt, I think that situation played out well because I wasn't sure if she was having them sent to her later or... Yeah. I'm glad it played out the way it did. It felt fine. I was glad I was able to give her the sheets because I didn't want to store them, so I was just going to give them away. So, yeah, it felt kind of awkward at first because I wasn't sure why that was happening, but yeah, it felt good after. I don't know. Yeah, I think I'm...",

Freshman year was almost entirely virtual. The spring was like, classes were virtual, but we were on campus in dorms, and it was weird, and COVID and everything. But in summer it was a little better because people got vaccinated and stuff. I was still around campus for the summer because I didn't want to go back home across the ocean during weird COVID time, so I stayed here. So, me and like four other friends, somehow we were able to rent an actual house in Somerville for the summer. It's very cheap. I think that house rented out was the same as the next summer when a few of my friends rented an apartment in Boston, which is crazy because it was a whole house with three floors. I think that was just the COVID summer housing prices. Nobody was living anywhere. But I felt really free to be myself because we had really big rooms and so much space. It's definitely the most spacious place I've ever been in. We have a whole basement area that we could hang out in, and the living room as well, and then a big stocked kitchen. And also the neighborhood was really nice. We had a big Market Basket like five minutes away, and we would go on nice walks to places. It was a little far from campus, but that was okay because also I didn't go on campus that much. And yeah, I felt like I just had a lot of both time and space to do whatever I wanted and hang out with people. Yeah, it was just a really nice situation, which I don't know if I could get something like that again so easily because it was a unique circumstance, but yeah.",

So, I based this on narrativity, which is the idea of telling stories through narrative. To tell a good story, you set the scene, you create the tension, and you describe how you feel. But there are many other roles I considered adding and could have different interactions as well. So, the game doesn't have to be played with three. It could be one of 16, and you get a different role every time. Cool. Thank you so much, and thank you for going over. I very much appreciate it. Yeah, I have just a really fast survey, if that's okay, but we can head on out. And if you guys want any more food, we can grab that.",

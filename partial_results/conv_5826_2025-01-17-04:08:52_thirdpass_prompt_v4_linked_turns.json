    "words": "So welcome to the small group conversation that is a part of a joint pilot led by the MIT Center for Constructive Communication and Frontline. Just a quick, we're going to do the whole kind of spiel that we did last time because we have Olivia joining us today, and I did want to thank you guys all for your time. I know that today's a bit of a bigger stretch that we're going to be doing, but you guys will be compensated for this with above $50. I'm not sure if it's $50 per conversation or if it's ... I know it's not $50 a total, but you'll be getting more than $50, I can guarantee you that much. So thank you for your time and I'm excited for you guys to spend that money on whatever you guys want. So quick description of what the MIT Center for Constructive Communication is, this is the team that I've been working with for about two years, and we essentially work on promoting Equitable. We focus on hosting a lot of different conversations, really promoting dialogue, especially those between polarized groups or different groups that there might be an equity gap in just to really facilitate a lot of what is often missed within different conversations in different groups. And Frontline is an organization that essentially creates a whole bunch of documentaries. We probably watched one of them in school for a different subject at one point, but that's a little bit, I just kind of winged those descriptions, but you guys can google more about what they do and all of that. But there is that, and essentially what our group, the Center for Constructive Communication, is trying to do is we want to better understand how Frontline's documentaries impact how you see the world and connect with one another. So the goal of our conversation today is to understand your experiences, interests, and concerns as the next generation of news consumers. Well, can you guys just throw a thumbs up in terms of, \"Yeah, I'm okay with being recorded with my face and my voice.\" Lovely. Got all of you. That's great. All right. I will now begin facilitating an intentional type of conversation centered on sharing personal stories. So a lot of conversations like even amongst this group, because I've had various conversations with you about all kinds of topics, even ones that Gentry should not have walked in on. But having said that, [inaudible], anyways, sorry. What I'm trying to say is that often we start off conversations a lot with our stance on the point of discussion or what that might be like as opposed to an anecdote, and then tying that into why that might've shaped your experience or how that might've changed you. And so, the focus of this type of conversation is really about sharing personal stories. And so, if you guys start off with your own point and stance, that's fine. I'm probably going to see if I can get an anecdote out of that. But just keep in mind that throughout these conversations, we'd really like to hear your personal experiences or what dialogues may have even shaped the opinion that you happen to be sharing. So that's that. The MIT group designing this conversation is finding that this approach helps build connections and deepen mutual understanding. Are there any questions so far? Lovely. Okay. Before we begin, I want to review some conversation agreements, including some baseline agreements that I will throw in the chat. You guys can just read this. I found that the whole, I'll read one and then you guys throw your hands up was unnecessarily tedious. So if you guys could just be like, or that sounds cool or I'm fine with that, that'd be great. Okay. I am seeing, I have no clue. I don't anticipate it being [inaudible], but Neha I just want to make sure that you're also on board with this because I did not see a response from you. Oh, I'm sorry. Your thumbs up. That was my bad, but thank you. Looky, looky, looky, looky, looky. Glad to hear that you guys love these. So I'm going to kick us off with a quick round of introduction, even though we all know each other, but for the sake of the system that this audio will be processed through, what it does, and it was actually really cool. For those of you who do not know, the transcript from our first conversation was actually transcribed through a system and it actually was able to recognize who was saying what because of our introduction. So there would be an anecdote and it would be played and it would have Kate's name by it and I could listen to it and be like, \"Oh my god, that's Kate's voice.\" Or it would have Nathan's voice and Jack, it would be like Jack S. And like Nathan. However you choose to introduce yourself, that will be the name that you have. So if you guys also don't want to be ... If you don't want to have your real name, feel free to use any other name, but I will begin. So as I said, just first name, pronouns if you want to share, and what you had for lunch today. I shall begin, as I said, my name is Duthie. I use she/her pronouns and I am yet to have a lunch, but I heard that it will be ash gourd curry, and I am waiting for that very patiently. Anybody want to go next?",

I will also be harassing my parents for my lunch in this gap. So having said that, the topic that we're going to be watching or really discussing, but the video is also about is Boeing and airline safety. So as you're watching, try to notice the ideas that do or do not resonate with you and then think about how you feel when different people are talking. And when I say different people, I mean those that are in the documentary and we will discuss this more thoroughly afterwards. Give me a quick second to get this started and we can begin.

But airlines are not something that the general public knows or has a lot of access to information about.

So I was like, okay, so this is probably just normal. Right? And I had no idea. And then after, the pilot was like, \"Ah, sorry guys.

There was a lot of panic, fear, and anguish kind of in the passengers of this flight. On the other hand, you've got these analysts being like, \"Yeah, well if they want to become the brand that they are,\" or that they were rather, \"it is going to be 14 years.\" And just to think that life-threatening scenarios could also be looked at from a business perspective, and potentially ... Obviously, they can understand as humans, okay, yes, this is a safety concern to X, Y, and Z people, but to also think about it from a very commercial aspect I think is quite a commentary not just on this industry but in so many others in general. To see the documentary shift from a very people kind of having this tone of terror, this very nonchalant of, \"Yeah, they want to make money. If they want to come back to where they're that they just kind of got to suck it up and fix it.\" I'm like, \"Wow, okay, that's fun.\" But yeah, I do think that could also be a point in part as to why there is a lack of communication and disregard for more sensitive issues on this note.

Every rental car in a 40-mile radius was completely and utterly sold out. You couldn't get a train ticket out. Delta couldn't pay back everybody at once because it was just such an insane volume. The helplines to get to the help desk wrapped through the hallways. I have photos and videos of it. It is one of the most incredible just volumes of people I've ever seen in one place. And the energy in the room, everyone's anxious, babies are crying, people have been there. We were in line for something. And I remember this woman comes up to me and she's crying and she's like, \"Hey, I'm so sorry to ask you this, but can you please save a place for us in this line? I've been here for three days, I can't get out. I have three little kids and I don't know what to do.\" And just seeing how something so simple as Windows going down could so significantly impact thousands of people in such a profound way. And honestly, I kind of feel a little bit guilty every time I do talk about it because I was lucky I got out that same day. I was at the airport for what? 12 hours, which I was one of the luckiest people I talked to. There was a woman who said that she'd been awake for 30 hours straight. People sleeping all over the airport floor. And it was, I don't want to sound like I'm a jerk when I complain about it, but yeah, it was something else.

    "words": "No, I didn't see that. Okay. I will share two quick stories. So I recently came back from a trip in India and while I was there, this whole Microsoft thing went down. And legit, it was the day before I flew out too. was like, oh my God, are you flying Delta? And I'm like, yeah. She's like, \"Dude, be careful.\" And at that point I knew this was a thing, but I didn't realize it was affecting airlines. And so I was like, \"Oh.\" we made it back. That's fine. But earlier that week, my cousins from Seattle were trying to fly out to India and they had this lay over in Dubai, so they got on their plane except a few seconds after they take off, these alarms start blaring and the monitor was just showing their flight. The pilot's like, \"Hey, we got to turn around. There's something wrong with the flight.\" And my youngest cousin in this cohort, I think he's like, I want to say he's four, and he's crying his eyes out and my aunt's just recording it. And my younger cousin, who's the sister of the kid, she's like eight, no, she's about as old as she was. Okay, nevermind. She's 11. I just can't wrap my heads around the fact that they're big and old now. But anyways, she's about 11/12 and she's asking her dad like, \"Wait, why can't they just fly us through this thing?\" And her dad's panicking being like, \"Guys, something's wrong with the flight.\" And it's like, \"Oh.\" And so they land, but for their grandparents who are hitting 70-80 to hear that something happened to their flight, to get a video of, I kid you not, the flight was going and then it goes from a white path to a red line. And then just to see how quickly it just around on the monitor, I'm watching it shocked myself. The amount of fright this might've given their grandparents is terrifying to even think about. And I really hope it's not a case of neglect, but naturally just seeing this, I wouldn't be surprised. But I think it's a little bit frustrating that there isn't as much coverage on this topic. And then even then, Kate, one more thing, and this is a bit more of a sensitive thing. A week from today on Friday, my uncle passed away and his daughter just had a, well, she's four months old now and they're in Atlanta. And so two days before, he wasn't doing that great. He's like, \"No, you should totally stay.\" But just because of all the cancellations, the things they were like, \"Maybe we should wait.\" So then we get the news that my dad's sister's husband had passed away. So my dad calls her and she's bawling her eyes up being like, \"It's terrible.\" Then we're all very, I've never seen my dad cry. I saw him cry for the first time and that made me cry. But it is just sad to think that even the smallest of things can have a very big impact like the butterfly to tsunami effect, but with people's lives that I know this one isn't directly related to airlines, or an airline-based issue in itself, but just the larger system at hand that we're dealing with. So all right, next question. We don't need touch wood for this. So after watching the videos, have your feelings about Boeing or the issue of airline safety change? Why or why not? Anybody can jump in on this one as well.",

It was said in the video too after the part of the jet flew off the thing, they stopped a bunch of their planes from flying, but then almost a year later they just let all the planes fly again, which it's not fully like they're ignoring it, but they're also just like, \"All right, we're just going to go ahead and use all of them again.\" Hopefully they fixed the issue.

That can't be real.\" Apparently it was, which I guess is going back to Neha's whole Gen Z, optimistic nihilism thing, where it's like everything is a joke, nothing really matters, but I feel like it's kind of demonstrates how vulnerable humans really are just in general, whether it's to natural elements or even to things that we do to ourselves that I feel like people don't think about or we choose to ignore. The same way that we know how risky it is to get in a car every single day, and yet we do it multiple times a day, at convenience, at will, because it just becomes so commonplace to ignore the danger something presents in favor of the convenience that it offers. And I'm not saying that that should change our behavior because people need to go places, our world needs to be connected. And I think it's a great thing that it is, but it definitely puts in perspective how vulnerable we are as people. And I feel like that's one of those things where it would be very beneficial. I know this is probably counter to the interests of Boeing, but it'd be beneficial for them to stay in touch with the public as a corporation and make sure they're actively communicating with people so that people can make informed decisions about their safety.",

My biggest question right now is kind of unanswerable and it's what is going to be done about this going forward? What is going to change? Boeing, like you guys have mentioned, they are such a large market holder, but with all of the very intense public pressure that they've gotten recently, I don't see a future for the company that doesn't involve some degree of change. You hear negative press about Boeing everywhere you look, even the smallest incidents at Boeing now, everything is under a lot of public scrutiny. So I'm definitely very curious to see what is going to be done moving forward, how the company is going to change, what that's going to mean for consumers because the way it is right now, especially after that whole Windows thing as well, I feel like just air travel in general is not super sustainable the way it is.

To me, I'm like, oh my God, I love airports. I love flying on planes, which is still true, but I hate to bring this up, it's also a sensitive topic, but Kate your point in terms of the whole system in itself is extremely susceptible to the smallest of things. If we were to even think about 9/11, this conversation of airline safety has been technically big since then. It feels like it might've simmered down because it might just be the crude Gen Z humor that we have today and the culture that I'm exposed to, oh my God, 9/11, right. But having said that, I think that there really is just a bigger sense of ... I feel as that this is a very sensitive issue that really isn't being treated at the core. But I will say, just in terms of this video in general, I am very grateful that Frontline decided to create a documentary on this. I find that even though I might not have cared about it before, I think after watching it and even having this discussion, just those anecdotes kind of strike me as, okay, maybe this is a bigger issue that I'm able to kind of see or than I might've thought it would've been. And Kate, I completely agree with the question that you have. I'm just curious to know what would happen going forth and just if there's anything that can be done at the ground level, not the people that go like this, but I mean that the very basics of what the company kind of is and production lines and all that jazz.

And if there is, are they not following them or are they finding loopholes? Because that's one thing where I wonder what's the legality of this?

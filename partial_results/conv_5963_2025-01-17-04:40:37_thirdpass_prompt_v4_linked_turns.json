I will now start facilitating an intentional type of conversation centered on sharing personal stories and experiences rather than positions on issues. The MIT group designing this conversation found that this approach helps build connections and deepen mutual understanding. So before we, again, I'm just going to throw the same conversation agreements in the chat. If we could just verify that. Be like, \"Yes.\" Some points to two minutes max. And we will also request... Other one was... Oh, yes. Please consider personal anecdotes when possible. Does that work for everybody? Just a quick thumbs up, over the screen, all around the board. Cool. Okay. All right. I'm going to kick us off with a round of introductions. Please share your name, pronouns if you'd like to, and a color that reflects your mood today. I'll start. My name is Duthie. My pronouns are she/her and I would say orange. Just because this is a lot of work and I appreciate you guys being here. Sorry for stealing your color Jack, but also, it's been a good day so far. It's sunny, it's bright, I'm probably going to get some physical exercise because I've been sitting, preparing and analyzing all lot of our conversations prior. And so my butt is like, \"Get up and move your...\" So yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Who wants to go next?",

But I recently watched, and I think it was this teenager who was a victim of the Sandy Hook shooting. And it was basically people claiming that it wasn't real and demonizing this literal teenager having gone through this traumatic experience because they believed he was an actor, because they believed it was a government setup to undermine the NRA or whatever. And so, that's what immediately came to mind for me. But what I noticed is that they talked very little about, at least in this clip, they talked very little about the actual consequences of poor gun control in America and much more about the policies, the corruption and the political drama happening within the NRA. Which I was confused about. And maybe I just went in thinking it would be something different. So I had my expectations set incorrectly. But that stood out to me.",

Oh, maybe a lot of it was because of gun control and gun safety laws because of a lot of violent acts that happened during that time. And I mean, it makes it understand, oh, this really was super significant because back in 2010, that's when these maps were set and the gerrymandering occurs from both sides. But it was specifically gerrymandered a lot for one side and showing that it was so significant, the gun control issue was that it flipped it.

Even in my document, it very explicitly marks that how kids changed this whole revolution or started this whole revolution discussing gun control and all of that. But I think it went more into the political side and then just the type of corruption and more from a government perspective as a whole. Which I think is certainly interesting. But I think it strays away from the main topic at hand. But I will say I really was shocked by the amount of corruption that is backed in this organization, I guess. But, I really don't have anything that I can say personally aside from that. I mean, I think really because the focus of this video in my mind were about the corruption, I don't really know what I can say on that. But yeah, I know the next conversation is about gun control and gun violence in school settings and things. So I'm sure that's going to prompt more of a personable response from us. As Avni mentioned, it was certainly a little bit less personal as a video clip in itself. But yeah, I'm hoping that the next prompt will drive us more towards that personalized approach and prompt. So I'm joined in the chat right now. Please share again, touch wood, please share a story of a time you tried to talk about gun violence at your school. Did you end up frustrated? Did you change your mind or did you change someone else's mind? And I don't know if, as a school, we've had many conversations about this? I know amongst our friend group we might've. But in general, if you've had any conversations, how did that go? And all of that jazz, if you did it all?",

After the Oxford shooting, we weren't in school for a couple of days. And I think the way I heard adults talk about it, they talked about it in a very serious manner.

I understand why there is this flippancy in how we discuss violence in context of schools. But I have found it reductive.

These sorts of violence and the way that we talk about them, the way that we interact with them, I think is maybe inappropriately flippant.

I completely agree with the word of performative. Just in terms of it was just like a do it to do it, do it to look good, do it to stand by the cause. But, most of the people in the walk, I can guarantee you, me and most of my friends did not know what we were signing up for. We were like, \"Dude, walk out of school. Like, yo.\" So we just went.

One thing I might just like to add is that I've had conversations about gun violence with my parents before. But I think because of my lack of awareness about the topic in general, at least when I was first exposed to it, this whole incident happened. Obviously as I grew, my understanding of it increased and my sensitivity to it increased because it could have been something that very easily and quickly affected all of us or people that I really cared about. And so I try and have conversations with my parents about it being like, \"Guys, this is a real thing.\" And I don't think it really struck them until the MSU event where our family friends were actively on campus or they saw the shooter and dodged a bullet, because that happened to one of my family friends. And my mom hearing that from this kid's mom on a WhatsApp call was apparently more important than me with my credibility of being a student. Because I think it might also be a difference in experience because naturally for us we understand that it's something that could impact us, but for others that hear about events that happen in the news, they can almost be this understanding of if it's not happening to us or if it's not directly in our... I don't know what the words are, but if it's not directly in our lives, it's not immediately a problem or affecting us. And I think that's just an interesting thing that shaped my conversation with them. And now they're very aware of it. And they're like, \"Be careful wherever you go and yada, yada, yada.\" But, yeah, I just think that credibility also has a big point in this and that each generation takes this topic in a very different light. But, yeah, that's my thing on that. So I often end up frustrated with my parents in beginning and now it's like they understand it and all that jazz. But, okay. Next prompt. After watching the video, have your feelings about the issue changed? Why or why not? And I think this is going to be interesting because we've actually delved a little bit more into the controversy and politics and all that jazz behind it.

Everything is a political issue. You could also get a really empathetic view of a shooting. I know what happened at MSU was really wildly publicized as, \"This is an incredible tragedy, we need to fix this,\" all that kind of stuff. And so I feel it's a coin flip. Do you get the politicized version or do get the human version? And, so what Avni was saying about how the video zooms out and says, \"Hey, all of these issues are related. Yes, politics for sure. But also people\" so viewing that from, like Avni was saying, a systemic lens and recognizing that it all falls under the umbrella of one major issue is both important and uniting.

One question that I was left with after watching this video is if this documentary is going to, I guess address maybe a good faith opposition. Because a worry I have in conversations like this is that when we're addressing radicalization of things like the NRA and people who are radically in support of easing gun control restrictions, things of that nature. That it is ignoring people who have genuine good faith opposition to gun control laws. And for whatever reason probably do not deserve to be painted as monsters who hate children and don't care. And you see the world as like, \"Okay, it's worth it to extend children's lives for my freedom to own a gun.\" I don't think that that's an accurate representation of your average American gun owner. And I think that sometimes in these conversations of gun control that can get lost. And I think there is more opportunity to have fully educated good faith conversation and create actual change. If we come at it from a perspective that the average person who owns a gun probably doesn't because they feel that is a safer, more responsible choice. The same reason that a person who doesn't own a gun does it because they feel it's a safer, more responsible choice.",

But they don't say, \"I want to be able to get a gun whenever I want, no consequences. I just want to have a gun.\" If you told them, \"Hey, would you submit to a background check to get a gun?\" They would say, \"Absolutely, I haven't done anything wrong.\" And like you were saying, their opposition to gun control wouldn't be that they want everyone to be able to have a gun. It would be that they feel everyone should have the right to defend themselves or the right to be safe. And they don't want that process to be difficult for people.

And if this is supposed to be a representation of what is in the documentary, I think that there's way too much focus on that. It's very misleading, given that, even our conversation guide listed that we're going to be... I'll actually read what's highlighted. It says how Parkland students inspired a national conversation around gun control. And I feel as if the Parkland students part was not even a fifth of it. It was that one little shot, and then it was like, bam, this is what a senator is doing. Then this is the everything else in the NRA... And so, more focus on the actual story and what the students did that created this movement is what I would like to know. And also, as I mentioned earlier, just the perspective of people who actually engage in the purchasing of firearms and what their intentions are so they can also hear a not skew thing of this, \"Guns are bad.\" They can also have their own advantages to them. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the Second Amendment. But it's worth recognizing that there are people that do, and they have fine intention behind their support for it. So yeah. Any other thoughts, feedback? It is time for wrap up. So, thank you all for sharing your thoughts.

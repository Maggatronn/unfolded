Welcome to the small group conversation that is a part of a joint pilot led by the MIT Center for Constructive Communication and FRONTLINE. We also want to... Okay. We want to better understand how FRONTLINE's documentaries impact how you see the world and connect with one another. We're going to do our warmups or not warmups, our introduction kind of standing up. So stretch because I've been keeping you sitting for a whole hour. So having said that, the goal of today's conversation is to understand your experiences, interests, and concerns as the next generation of news consumers. Do you consent to having our conversation today recorded? Can we just do a thumbs-up? Cool. Okay. All right. I will now start facilitating an intentional type of conversations centered on sharing personal stories. A lot of our conversations often start off with a main point, but we really want to hear a driving anecdote as to what might've shaped that or a conversation you might've had prior that would've also shaped or given you said experience or opinion. So the MIT group designing this conversation is finding that this approach helps build connections and deepen mutual understanding. Before we begin, we have the same guidelines as previous and prior. I'm going to throw those back in the chat. If I could just get your verification one more time. I'm going to add that comments request that they stay under two minutes and that we really try our best to pull on an anecdote if possible. And again, this is kind of graded discussion style. It's not graded though, so just feel free to bounce off anybody points. If you don't have a story at that point, that's fine. Keep the conversation going in a natural way. Just we'd like to make sure that we can keep it as relevant as possible. Sound good? Cool. So I'm going to... Or, sorry, do you want to say anything about these guidelines? Thumbs down if no. Nathan, you do want to change something about them? Okay. That's fine. Lovely. Alrighty. I am going to kick us off with a round of introductions. Please share your first name or fake name if you don't want your actual name being recorded. Pronouns if you would like and your favorite type of popcorn. I will start or favorite flavor of it. So my name... Actually, are we feeling popcorn or ice cream? Actually Jack's anaphylactic. I'm sorry. So going back to the question of popcorn, my name is Doothee. I use she/her pronouns, and I like any type of spicy popcorn. Anybody else want to jump in?",

Now as you're watching, try to notice the ideas that do or do not resonate with you. Think about how you feel when different people are talking and we will discuss this more in detail after. Sound good? Give me a second to share screen this, this, and bam. Can you guys see this? All right. And keep in mind that this is the same docu... Or trailer kind of style. This is at two minutes so much shorter, but can you guys hear this as well? Cool. All right, here we go.",

I actually haven't seen a lot of information about videos about food insecurity that also deal with homelessness. They're almost sometimes treated as two separate issues, which I feel like is also partially because the stigma surrounding homelessness is much more intense than the stigma surrounding food insecurity. The face of homelessness in America, because we have such a high standard of living and we have a lot of places that are very affluent, tends to be like Avni said, one of blame. So homeless people are blamed for being homeless because of various circumstances that occurred in life, whereas especially child food insecurity and child poverty, you never see anyone blaming the kids for being in poverty or people who live in food deserts. You rarely see people being blamed for not having access to fresh produce. So I think that was one thing I was thinking about too in the video is it was interesting to me to see that they're exploring the intersection of those two struggles.",

Bouncing off what you were saying, especially in the context of schools being an important part of this puzzle, something that was initially pretty striking to me is that 20 million kids in the country are on low-cost to free lunches. And it really kind of, I guess puts some scrutiny on the way that our schools are funded based on income tax in the states because that system, it does feel would create a situation in which the communities that really need those resources, really need kids to be able to go to school and get a healthy filling lunch for free are the ones who are going to be seeing the least amount of money put towards those resources. And with that volume of kids getting that food every day, that might be a huge amount of the food that they get throughout their childhood. It also raises some scrutiny to know why are we feeding such a large subset of our future population for their entire childhood with food that we really understand now to be dangerous and especially with constant consumption, dangerous or inadequate.",

There are so many different shades and looks of food insecurity. My mom talks about how she experienced food insecurity when she was younger, but if you look at her circumstances, they weren't rich. They definitely weren't rich, but she had a roof over her head. She had two parents who both worked... Actually, no, a parent who worked and a parent who didn't. So there was income coming in all the time. And so I feel like that's one thing I think about a lot is if I had looked at my mom's family from the outside, I wouldn't know they were experiencing food insecurity, but I've heard my mom talk about it and I can see it in the way she interacts with food now like what Avni was saying.

    "words": "Yeah. And I think just adding to that, a key example of someone we can look at. I mean first of all, when I watched this video I was very shocked by the statistics and I think to see it, obviously, we're aware of it. Even in our IB languages, they're like, talk about these issues. So I know that they exist, but to visually see it, I felt it struck a much more emotional chord in me because it's not the kid... Sorry, this is again an issue of distributing blame kind of thing, but naturally, there's not much that they can do about it. And also, again, I'm so grateful that the education system has something in place to support them because I think we're lucky enough that they provide somewhat nutrition food. Most of it is one color, that's fine, but at least there's something to help them sustain. And I know that when I was in fifth grade, I wrote to the superintendent of Ann Arbor schools and was like, \"Hi, I want you to fix this.\" And then I left and then she did fix it, which just makes me happy to know that there is also scope for healthier food and change in that field as well. But I think it's just really saddening that this issue, they're aware and often we think about these issues as being adult problems, but the fact that they can also impact kids almost brings a completely different perspective onto it. And one more person that I'd like to reference in this conversation is Mr. Pearson. I know that in the conversation that he had with the band kids, he mentioned that he grew up using food stamps. And I don't think that's what a lot of people would anticipate when they look at Mr. Pearson just in terms of how he lives now. But just because of his very humble way of... I mean, okay, he wears Gucci and Versace every day, but to live the way that he does with such grounded values and morals, I think it's very much shaped by the upbringing that he came up with. And I know that as Jack was saying, it can be an issue of shame because I know that my dad couldn't get food every single day, and so he would just have to suck it up and go with whatever could happen because he lived in a family of six and rotating cousins that might just be staying with them and they got priority because of just hospitality in immigrant households I guess. And so growing up, as a lot of you guys know, I'm a pretty picky eater and I love to say, \"Oh my God, I love food.\" Which is true, except when a lot of people see me eating, they see me leaving portions. But a lot of what you guys don't see is that I come home and I'm forcing myself to eat it because my dad growing up would be like, \"If you leave that you're going to get it.\" And getting it would just mean you get a lecture from me and I understand the sensitivity of it because as I grew up, he would imply that this was going on in his life without explicitly telling me. And so that just struck me as this thing of, oh, well this is a real issue and it obviously matters a lot. And I'm glad that having conversations and having a large immigrant population can also help share the reality of this and not just the immigrant population, people who have been able to come out of that successfully. I think it's just a powerful narrative to be able to share and I think that in itself is also very much shaping how we lead our lives as the next generations. All right, next prompt. Bam. This one's a little bit of a loaded one, so I'll let the conversation points for this be a little bit longer than what they've allocated, which is about 10 minutes. But the prompt is have you or has anyone else you know been affected by food insecurity? Have you tried to offer support, raise awareness, or did you have conversations about poverty or food scarcity? Did you end up frustrated? Did you change your mind or did you change someone else's mind? And obviously, these are just the questions that we have as guiding factors, so feel free to use any of these and just jump off of whatever you feel most compelled on. But yeah, I will open up the floor because I know we opened and talked about some points within this, so if anybody wants to go feel free to.",

So this friend, she actually ended up being diagnosed with type I diabetes like myself, and the way that having like her family having to pay for insulin and on top of the already strained financial situation that they were in with food and how much managing that disease also impinges on very careful management of food and having constant access to food. She ended up going into the foster care system and it is incredibly unfortunate how somebody who has had, I guess a birth family who wasn't inappropriate for other reasons, but was inappropriate by means of just financial. There were other compounding factors, but again, these finances were a large portion of it could end up being put into the system, getting her life uprooted at such a young age. It really is unfortunate how precarious people's lives can be when there's already this existing pressure of food scarcity. All it takes is a straw to break the camel's back when you're already in this just precarious life situation. And it is a very delicate and unfortunate thing and it's hard to fix. It's hard to fix in a global meaningful way because if it was easy, we would've done it. I don't think it's out of cruelty that these issues still exist.

I'm not saying that I think there's an easy solution to it, but I also feel like it speaks to there might be a flaw. I feel like there's flaws in the way we handle certain situations like that because it definitely feels like if they were not an unfit family for her to be in for other reasons and this was the primary reason that they're deemed unfit, it feels like the burden of blame is being shifted onto the family rather than the institutions that might have brought them to that point in the first place. Which I feel like is a reoccurring issue, especially in America, is blaming individual people or individual family units for situations that arise from circumstances that were completely not their fault or that they would just happen to be born into or something like that. I feel like that especially is present in families experiencing poverty, minority families, all stuff like that. Any kind of marginalized population.",

    "words": "Yeah, for sure. And one thing that I want to jump in on here and does anybody else have a point to share or was like... Go ahead, Doothee... We're good? Cool. Lovely. One thing that I would like to talk about was a little bit of the, have you tried to offer support, awareness, or have conversations? So conversations about poverty is something that my... It's not that we tend to avoid it, but because my dad has such a sensitive background with it, he'll very carefully open it up when it's really night hours, you just start spilling random things and you're like, oh, I didn't know that about you. It's kind of like that with my dad and I don't know anything else about his life and so we'll just be sitting and I'll be working. And he's just like, and he just starts going on and I'm like, oh. And then I try to have a more empathetic conversation to just understand or to know more about someone that I care about and he completely shuts off. And is like, \"No, we're not talking about that. You're only a kid.\" And I'm like, \"Bro, I'm 18 now, but thanks.\" So that's a little bit about that end of it, but in terms of having to support people, I know that there's this culture in India where a lot of people live in apartments and in the basement there's a guy or a family that happens to be the watch guard for them and they tend to often be stuck in this limbo of we don't get food on a daily basis because all we're doing is just making sure that only tenants of this apartment are entering. And so what a lot of people like to do is if they have any leftover food from their meals and they call these guys up and they're like, \"Hey, take some of this, take some of this.\" And they come with the same set of silverware every single day and they just take the food and go down, take the food, go down, and that's one of their biggest sources of food. And if they get any tips that night, then they'll get a packet of milk. So ultimately that's... The cost of milk it's insane in India, but also just... That's not my point. I'm sidetracking here. In terms of the fact that a lot of people tend to go... I find it, there's a culture of, what's it called? It's like the sharing is caring kind of thing, and so then you choose to give food in that way. But one thing that I found really beautiful is I know that's one very common way people do it in India, and I actually didn't know that there were fridges for the homeless in India. And so my grandma was... The grandma who's grandparents, their flight turned around. When we were staying with her she's like, \"Make sure you go and...\" She was telling her husband, \"Make sure you go put it in that fridge.\" And I'm like, \"Wow. Well, I didn't even know this exists.\" So I think it's just, and my grandma was also like, \"Oh, that's a thing.\" And I'm like, \"Woman, please don't be serious right now.\" And so I think it's just kind a commentary as to this is something that is not discussed and I find that very frustrating, but I'm glad that there is a sense of... I mean, naturally talk to my grandma about it be like, \"Bro, I'm so glad that you're giving food to those people and I'm so glad that you support them in a way as a family, but also you could also extend that same gratitude to larger community.\" And I'm lucky enough that my grandma and my extended family are very open-minded people, but I know that in my dad's side of the family, whatever they have left over... Honestly, I don't know if they have anything left over or if they eat it all because just of the way that they were grown up. But in my mom's family, she grew up with... She was one of the richest families. She's like, oh my God. Then she meets my dad and he's like... I don't know how they got together. But I think that's just a really interesting commentary in terms of how people treat the situation now and if there isn't dialogue, it can sometimes be treated through a sense of humanity. But yeah. Any other comments, things of the sort? All right, we can move on. So the next question is, after watching the video, have your feelings about the issues changed? Why or why not?",

    "words": "So I can start with this one. This video kind of reinforced what I know about the different ways that poverty and food insecurity can manifest in different communities because one, an initial exposure I had to it was when ingredient households were a micro trend, not like a trend, but a topic that was frequent on social media and people were like, \"Oh, I grew up in an ingredient household.\" And I was like, \"Oh, what is that? Where does it kind of stem from?\" It turns out that a lot of those are actually forms of food insecurity, not... Certain behaviors and the availability of buying snacks and whatnot actually can come from people who are more food secure. And so the whole discourse on ingredient households was what exposed me to that. And then this video showed me something that's I don't want to say more severe, but that's probably the only thing I could say about it like in this video, the girl who said they don't have a fridge and she was pouring bags of ice into the sink and that was their fridge. That really showed me that that's the tip of the iceberg. There's a whole lot more going on down there that I've never seen before. I mean, I guess my feelings about I haven't changed. It's still disheartening to know that people deal with this kind of thing and that the systems that are in place to help them are really not doing enough.

If I was suddenly experiencing food insecurity, I could post about it on my Instagram story, I could talk to other people. I have resources that I can reach out to, but someone living in an isolated rural area or someone who doesn't have internet at their house, or even something as simple as that, not having a computer, not having a phone creates a massive barrier to both receiving help and also disseminating information about what you're going through. So I feel like that really was one of the things that the video opened my eyes to was a lot of times when you see food insecurity talked about, it's in the terms of what Avni was saying, food deserts and people not being able to access fresh produce, which is of course a big issue, but seeing it presented in this expanded what I viewed as food insecurity.",

If I was suddenly experiencing food insecurity, I could post about it on my Instagram story, I could talk to other people. I have resources that I can reach out to, but someone living in an isolated rural area or someone who doesn't have internet at their house, or even something as simple as that, not having a computer, not having a phone creates a massive barrier to both receiving help and also disseminating information about what you're going through.

I've really never thought about the children aspect of it. I always thought about just adults that have been going through it.

I think it's because we all come from... I guess I shouldn't speak, but generally, I think you all would admit as well, we come from a place of enough privilege that this issue is not a driving underlying force in our everyday lives. And I feel like things like that do impact how we think about these issues or I guess maybe a better way of saying it, how much we don't, because I'm sure for the one in six kids who live in a home with food insecurity, this isn't an issue. They have the luxury to think about once every couple months or to think about in the context of a discussion or debate or anything like that. It is an underlying theme of their lives and it's something that is just all-consuming.",

    "words": "Yeah, that is one interesting thing that like Avni is saying, there are so many dimensions to this singular issue. And I know because I am in a very privileged position in life and I've not ever experienced food insecurity, but I have dipped my toe into the water of how does not having the proper nutrition affect your schooling and your education, and your future. One of the big things that they talked to me about when I first got diagnosed with my eating disorder was if you don't start properly nourishing yourself, you're going to see cognitive decline and a decline in function at school, at an academic level. And for me, it was a self-imposed problem. It was not a food insecurity issue. I just didn't want to eat, which is also part of the reason that I agree with Avni in that I don't feel like I am able to have a full understanding of this issue. I can really sympathize with people who are going through it, but I'll never truly understand what it's like to not know where your next meal is coming from. And so I feel like that's one of those things where if we as a group of people who I consider everyone in this chat to be incredibly empathetic. We are educated, we've been educated throughout our middle school and high school education because of the area that we live in and the values that it holds. If we as a group of people can't even fully empathize, then it's like, you can imagine how hard it is for someone who does not live in a really liberal place, does not get a lot of information and public education, and stuff like that. You can imagine how hard it would be for them to empathize with the issue of food insecurity. So yeah, I feel like one thing that stood out to me is that what Jack's saying, we all have a connection to this issue, but then also what Avni was saying is that we all have a connection to this issue, but none of us are directly affected by it. So yeah, that was interesting to me is both the connection and the detachment existing simultaneously.",

What did you guys appreciate and all of that? And I can get us started while you guys are thinking. The way it was kind of directed is, I don't know what YouTube channel it's on, I think it's The Brut B-R-U-T or something, and it has all these videos and the statistic just pops up on the right and then it goes to another clip and it just pops up on the left and there's a small commentary from someone who's educated in the field. And it kind of felt like one of those, which is what I get in my YouTube Shorts and how to stay informed about different issues and things. And so I know it was documentary style, but it felt very much like a YouTube Short. And I kind of appreciated the familiarity that brought because I think the statistics were also very standout. I meant to see just so many different perspectives and influences on food poverty in terms of having a white kid and then a Black kid speak just in their terms of different experiences and all of that.

So we really want to achieve that goal. It's really about engaging this kind of conversation around personal stories from our own lives and experiences. Rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues, we're going to go more about our experiences in our own lives.",

Thirdly, all conversations will become... part of the conversation will be developed by a nonprofit organization called Cortico. It's like MIT's development arm. And so their system creates a transcript of each recording tool, and they highlight keywords that emerge across different conversations and then they allow users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets, discover patterns, and so that's really what we're accomplishing here today. And really, just they say it's like a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. Bear with me. I have to say this next part verbatim so it's going to sound a little... obviously not as casual, but as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the RealTalk at Boston in transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the RealTalk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversation across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risks. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. Jasmine and I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this?

What do I do?\" But I think a lot of people helped me figure it out, which was nice. So the person who worked for the T, he tried helping me call my phone. That didn't work, but then he let me take the T for free, which was nice. So then I was able to take the T into work and then my coworker heard my little story and he was like, \"Ooh my gosh, take my phone, try to cancel your credit card and do all the things you need to do and figure out where your phone's at.\" And then I was able to get in contact with my Uber driver and she was so sweet.

It was so dark out. I just remember barely any light, and my neighbor that was next door knocked on my door and asked me if I wanted to just sit with her because she was scared, too.

But maybe on a more personal level, I think the group... I'm not going to speak for the group, but we're all young and starting our careers and I think part of that too, it's trying to balance doing your work and being satisfied with what you do versus also being conscious of the way that you're building your brand or having people take you seriously as well at work. I think when you are young, sometimes there's certain people that might not do that off the bat. You have to really earn trust that way, whereas some people can come in and have a little bit more of that equity, that brand equity, right away. So I think there's a little bit of that I think just with starting your career and trying to figure out what your life is, but definitely the rent thing is hard. She's tough.",

I would say for me too, growing up in Boston, something that I wish the kids going to school and attending school would have would just be more access to therapy or more access to counseling for community-based violence. I've probably lost more friends growing up between the ages of 15 to 17 more than I lost family members. So I will say, and that's something that's really constant if you ask people here in Boston, I think that is really, really helpful. Also too, there's just a lot of generational trauma. There's a lot of trauma when you live in certain living communities. There's certain economic classes that definitely are separated within the city. So if you're living in a housing development, now those housing developments are getting torn down because of the violence, but these people have nowhere to go, so you're kicking them out of these places. So it's like, \"Where do you expect them to go?\" So I definitely would say support that I would want from I guess Boston or just people that are elected officials would to really just start looking at why people are acting out that the way that they are in these certain areas in Boston, not just classifying it as just, \"Oh, all these people are angry, everything's happening,\" but there's a reason why there's so much violence that is coming through the city because it's so hard now. There's so many families that I know that have five, six kids and they're getting bare minimum with their food stamps. There's not a lot of accessibility for them to obtain anything, so I think that's also too something I would like to see. I guess just a little bit more support in my community with that. Also too, education. I was very blessed to be able to go out of the city to get to my education. I was very blessed to just have many different opportunities to go and experience different schooling, but that's not always the case for a lot of kids, especially people of color in the city. And I do support the METCO program, which is just bringing inner-city kids to different areas outside of Boston. But I think our education system within the city needs to be a lot better because we do have actual good resources here. We have a lot of great hospitals, we have a lot of good healthcare providers, so I think that we just need to pour into our city a little bit more and not just bring people in to make our city more expensive or to think that's what we need because there's a lot of support, there's a lot of actually good things coming from the city, so I think that's something that we definitely could benefit from.",

You clearly haven't done your due diligence. We're not going to pay for water that you haven't appropriately divvied between the different renters and stuff.\" They basically advocated their way out of paying, given that there was not the right setup in place, and it makes you think about how many other people just ended up doing what they said based off of the information that they were provided and not really knowing any better and knowing how to look for that kind of stuff.

I would say my hope would be our elected officials having more diversity, people of color, people of just any type of life experience. Also too, that was another thing I forgot to add. Getting the minority population to understand how important it is to vote and why their vote matters and understanding that these elected officials are going to serve and reach out to the people that are supporting them so if you're not there, they're not going to reach out to you and make sure that they get your vote. So I just think anything, voting education, in the inner city is important because I still to this day will have friends that aren't even registered to vote. I try to have those conversations with them, but granted, their reasoning is valid. They don't feel like their voice matters, but that's what the government wants you to think, that your voice does not matter so you don't go out and vote. I think that it's very important so hopefully 10 years from now, our numbers in the city of Boston for specifically minority communities will be tripled because that is the goal, to get your voice and your community in office to be seen, to be heard, whatever. Hopefully too, I want to see definitely more after school programs, like high schools, middle school, elementary schools, just getting redone, getting proper educators, even just educators from our city, people that go to school here that are residents here that have actually put in their time to get their degrees, to actually go into the community and teach here and actually get great benefits, get the salary that they deserve, just everyone getting poured into properly because I feel like we have the resources. They're just not getting allocated in the right way. I also would say too, the Boston roads are ridiculous. I hate them. They irritate me. My tires are always just all over the place. They need to fix the roads. Hopefully in 10 years we're driving cars that maybe are flying. I don't know what the 10 years will look like, but I think also too, just the environment of our city needs to be a lot better. We have street cleaning, but they just push things to the side. So I think actually taking care of the environment that we're in, the T stations, cleaning those up, and hopefully my last thing... I won't go on a rant because we'll be here forever... would be definitely taking care of our community that suffers from substance abuse because just me by living here for so long, just seeing how bad it's gotten, it's heartbreaking. I hate seeing it. And it's like they're pushing them out from Mass Ave, but they're putting them more into the city. That's causing a lot of friction, that's causing a lot of just tension throughout. And I just think we need a better system and way to care for these individuals because they are people. They've had probably good lives before whatever happened to them and causing them to now use. I think we need to actually make and implement things to have them go through the process of recovery because everything's not going to change in a day, but I think instead of just, I don't know, outcasting them and shutting them into one particular spot, we should be actually helping them so that they get in a mindset where they feel like they can progress and not be in their current situation. But obviously, that takes time and that takes people understanding that this is not just something you decide to do one day, like, \"Hey, I'm going to have this disorder. I'm going to struggle with this problem.\" I think people need to understand the actual facts about it and being educated on it, and our actual elected officials have to actually set a plan to get this problem fixed. We need treatment centers, we need actual people that are willing to go through the process to make this situation better because it is a public health issue because it does impact a lot of people in the city.",

I think that there is a whole system that contributes to homelessness, poverty, drug use, and I grew up poor and you either are not making any money and you're collecting benefits and it's almost like you're supposed to stay poor to receive those benefits, but once you start working your way towards the middle class, or even as a student I'm barely making enough to make it by here, but I'm not poor enough to collect benefits. So when you fall in that in between, you can't receive resources that would help you do well, do better. And I would like to see implements to help people that are struggling with substance abuse and find... like she said, not just run them off the streets. Shelter, getting them into therapy and then finding a route. But also for students, resources for students who are looking to feed into the community and better the Boston community, bring education in. We need resources, too. Food stamps would be amazing. You can only work so many hours outside. I think resource allocation is a really big thing that needs to be assessed.",

But part of it too is not letting people feel like they're invisible and letting them have a purpose as well. You can try to fix where someone lives maybe, but I don't know if you're going to really change... I don't think that always necessarily fully changes their life for the better, I guess. I think also too, when we talk about education, when everyone talks about Boston, they talk about, \"Oh wow, there's so many schools, so many hospitals.\" But as someone who went to a Boston university, not Boston University, but a Boston university, there's not a lot of minority students. It's pretty white across the board and that's fine. A lot of people come from different states, different places, but it would be great to see people of color. Yeah, so like I was saying, I think just from my own personal experience, building a more inclusive community in Boston needs to start at the beginning, obviously, with the local community, but I think as much as there are programs that are targeted... honestly, that's not even true. I feel like there's so many things that need to be changed. It's hard to fit in a little spiel.",

    "words": "Yeah. But yeah, I think it's tough, one, because I feel like even if there are programs, it's hard to get people aware of what they are and be able to sign up for them right away. I remember when I was in this club called Dream in college with Becca. We had this conversation with some of the kids' parents and they were saying that they literally had to sign their kid up to be bused to a better school away, so much earlier than even from when they even started school because the waitlist was so long and all the procedures were just so lengthy. You had to start right away to even get that chance. And that starts at the beginning. If those parents didn't know about those resources, you're already a step behind, it almost feels like. And it's hard to catch up, I think too, especially when there's big inequities already. Part of that I think as well is just figuring out what these underserved communities actually need or what they want. There's a reason why people feel like their vote doesn't matter and that they're not being heard is because they're actually not being asked what they want or what they want to change. These conversations are good because it at least helps people start to think about how they would want Boston to look like and what would actually help them. I know trying to figure out big solutions to big problems is tricky, especially for just a regular person that doesn't maybe have all of the knowledge or subject-specific expertise on policy issues. But I think the gap between the policymakers and then the people that are affected by those policies is significant, especially in the city, especially in Boston. And if there is one thing I think I would want to see changed in a more positive way is lessening that gap, to stop it.",

And I was thinking about my mentee who was signed up to go to one of those far away schools, and how many times I was like, \"Oh, how was school?\" And he missed a day that week because the bus never came. They had a problem finding drivers to get them to school. So I think a Boston I would like to see in 10 years in that regard even is just... it's not that big of a city. People should be able to get to where they need to get to. So public transportation that doesn't break down all the time, that doesn't need to be closed for a month at a time, that doesn't have a zillion slow spots... I understand it's a very old system that needs to be reworked, but I really hope in 10 years that it will have evolved in leaps and bounds in that way. And same with Sumner Tunnel. Can you imagine a summer 10 years from now where Sumner Tunnel stays open? That would be a miracle. So just to add on, I totally agree with everybody else, and I could go down a million rabbit holes, but where my head was at with that, where we hadn't really gone so much, so far as public transportation.",

I would say we're pretty cool and we have great insight and we all come from different backgrounds and there's so many differences between us, but we also are in a space too where we're able to have a lot of similarities and have actual conversations. And unfortunately, conversations like this don't happen as much as people would assume they happen, which I feel like needs to be the first thing. And just making people feel uncomfortable with not knowing everything and being able to own that and being able and willing and able to actually learn something new, because in this day and age, everyone's just trying to get through the day to day to keep their head above water. So no one's like, \"Well, let me take the time out of my day to understand this concept that I may not even really fully understand or may not really impact me directly, so what's the point?\" So I think we got to find that next step in terms of, how do we reach out to our demographic in terms of our age group that doesn't really want to have these conversations, that don't even think about these things, so that we can actually start making significant change because we're the next generation that's coming? We have to figure out a way to reach everyone, and regardless if you agree with everything or not, being able to say you agree with everything or not is important rather than not talking about it at all. So I think we got to get to a point where we're able to go into our communities and people that don't care about certain issues and don't know, we have to tell them. And yeah, that might be a little tedious, that may get pushback because it's easier to just stick with things that you are used to doing than things that you don't know. So I think that's something that we really have to try to work on.

That sounds cheesy, but I think it's nice that we're all hopeful that things can change and we actually have goals for how Boston can be better. I also think it's cool how different people on this call are trying to help improve Boston in different ways. So I think honestly, some takeaways for me from this combo are how can you fit that in? Because like Kaya was saying, in the day to day you lose that vision. I feel like you're just trying to get through the day for yourself and just figure everything out one at a time. But then it's hard even on a personal level to figure out what your bigger goals are, let alone how you could help others or contribute to that. So I think a big takeaway from this call is trying to figure out how. I think I sort of knew how I was doing that in school because there's a lot of programs and opportunities that were pretty accessible for me to help contribute to the Boston community, I feel like. Not as easy, I think, for me coming out of school to find those opportunities or I guess seek them out as well, so trying to figure out how to do that post-college.",

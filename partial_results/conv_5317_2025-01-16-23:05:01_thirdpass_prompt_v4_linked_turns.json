Generally with the games I design, there's no real right or wrong or winner or loser. It's just a nice chance to talk to each other in a different way. And so this game, the state that it's in is prototype-y. I'm still inserting a lot of words, so I'm going to verbally read the instructions and then based on your feedback, make some changes for future tests. As you're going through this, just think out loud and that way I can note it and make changes as we're going through. It's really casual, so just speak your mind, but as much as you can, try to lean into the game and see what happens. I'm super curious how it'll go. The way that this works is you scan the QR code in front of you with your phone. That will take you to a webpage where you can enter your name. One hopes.",

Again, placeholder kind of things, but basically this is a game about listening and having a conversation so that's really all that's going to happen. Essentially, we are truth tellers trying to find the true understanding of a certain problem. Each of us in that problem are going to play different roles, and through those roles we're going to try to uncover something new. And so the way we're going to do that is by taking turns answering questions. For example, in what aspects of your life are you most competitive? One of us will share what we're feeling and the others will listen. After the person is done sharing, other people are invited to enter information on their phone. And so it'll guide you what kind of information that you want to add, but each of us will play a different role. The roles are the seer, the seeker, and the something I forget that will come up, and it'll explain what all those roles are. But by each of us playing our roles and doing our part, we'll be able to create a cool image, and all of our answers will collaboratively and collectively go together in those images. Ideally, we want to create an image that in some way reflects the storyteller and what they're saying. It can be literally some of the elements that we pick up and care about in the story, or it can be figuratively and silly and emotions that vaguely recognize it. So as a group, we just all figure that out. And so we each do that, each attending to different aspects of the story. It's going to be all similar questions around the same theme, and then at the end, we'll be invited to unlock the truth, and when we do, it'll create a center image, which blends a little bit of all of these things based on what we've cared about. Yeah, there's backstory. These are random ones. But anyway. So yeah, that's how the game is played. I'll be here. Since I'm playing, I'll be also able to answer the rules as they go, but try your best just to take a guess at what the rules are so I get about what's intuitive and what's not.",

The husband and wife have two sons who are both older than me, but they were not frequently at home so I just basically live with them and a dog. It was great because it was my first experience being outside of a family and also being in a completely new country. My English was not as good as now. They really saw me as their own daughter basically. We still keep in contact until this day. I would say this is a very unique roommating situation because it's more like a family other than just being under the same roof.",

And then the pandemic happens, and then we're going to move in during the pandemic. So really the fifth time we actually hung out, we had moved in together. It was fast friends kind of situation, and I think she is a lovely human, but we had so much conflict. It just got so stressful. It just was like we got too close and then we really were into digging into each other's psyche. Because it's the pandemic, you have nothing else to do. We would sit on the couch and just talk about these things and we started to being really blunt to each other. And she's just really different. And if I can say, most of my friends who I keep, I love them because they love other people and are really friendly, because that's what I like too. When I go to a party, I love meeting new people, I'm inclusive, I warm people in. And she's really not like that. She was like, we have to stick it with the loyal crew. Don't go and talk to... So many values were just not actually aligned but we wanted to make it work, and I think that that strong desire to actually be close, close, close, conflicted with just purely we're just different people.

And then because it's everyone's food, people should be more careful about how you're using it. Don't waste stuff. Same with cleaning, having a schedule. I did that in the previous apartment with other people, and the reason I did it was because they were comfortable with me doing it. They were happy with them not having to do all that, or at least organizing it. But then I think there's a difference between agreeing to do it and then following through, and I would try to keep them accountable. And then it got annoying. I think one of the realizations at that point was that you have to accept certain flaws in people if you're living with them, and if they can somehow accommodate in other ways or compensate in other ways, it's easy to live with people.

And I think it might strain when you stay in the relationship, a little bit like in your case. I also wonder if I was living with them during pandemic, it might have been different. I might have had a similar experience as you did. But then I also realized not everybody has to do things according to how I want it to be. I don't think 50/50 works all the time.

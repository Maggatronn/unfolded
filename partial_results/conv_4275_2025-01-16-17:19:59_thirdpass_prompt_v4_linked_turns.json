    "words": "Hello, hello, hello? Cool. Okay, cool. Yeah, I think that is all I need to say about that. Let's play this game, and whenever you need to jump out, it's like any game, so you can leave whenever. So the way that the game is played is by interacting with these image cards. These image cards are actually generated by AI, based on different values of different students. Yeah, yeah. That's your hand, so you can take a look. You don't have to show anyone your cards. And the goal of the game is to use these cards to tell stories and to encourage each other to tell stories. So the game will start like this. There'll be one storyteller denoted by the storyteller token. So let's say I'm the storyteller first and I hold the token, I get to pick one story thread to start my story. There's a level one card, a level two card, and a level three card. And they just differ on how deep or how complex or how... You'll see the difference. So let's say I choose level one, this card says, \"The aha moment where everything just clicked.\" I'm going to look in my hand and find an image card that in any way represents what I'm feeling about this card. So I have these cards, which I'll just show you just because we're templing. And maybe I would pick something like... I don't know, maybe something like this. I'm not at all someone who would associate myself with... Hello! Thank you. Come have a seat. I'm just explaining how to play the game. We're sitting down to talk about our values and some things that we care about, about education and... Oh, thank you so much. I think it's connected now. And we're using the game to play. So I'm going to deal you in. The game starts by assigning a storyteller, who I'm just demoing. Right now that storyteller is me. And so, when I pick up a card, which you pick from these story thread piles, you look in your hand and you try to match a card to the story that you have in mind. And it's going to be really loose because the cards are really ridiculous. So don't try too hard to make it perfect. So yeah, something like... When I came to MIT, I really didn't associate myself with just generally a science and working-in-a-lab kind of person, I more was almost maybe more... I don't know, don't quite have a card. Maybe more chaos or more dance-y, embodied. But I think at one point in my education I did have this clicking moment. Because it was like here in this lab, people learn from each other all the time and I'm like, Oh, this is the way I like to learn. Anyway, I could go on and tell that story. So that would be an example of a way to use this to tell a story. After that, all of you now have the chance to play one of your cards. So if any of your cards is similar to this card, you can look down and play it. So maybe... I don't know if I have different type of cards. Maybe you'd be like, \"Oh, this one is very similar.\" And once you do that, you have the option of either bridging or tunneling. A bridge is this white token here, and a tunnel is the black token. So if your story relates and you'd like to share your own story that's similar - maybe you say, \"I also had this feeling as well, all these TVs everywhere,\" something like that - you would bridge between these two. And then this would create a thread. If you were interested in my story and you want me to go deeper, you use the tunnel card. So you could say something like, \"What were you doing before MIT that got you to that position? Was it something like this?\" And you could use this card to formulate that question. Again, use the cards broadly. There's no real right or wrong to it. Does that make sense?",

So why don't we go with you first since you're maybe shorter on time? I'll move the storyteller token to you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Let's do a warmup first so we can all introduce each other and each other's names. The warmup for this round is, pick the image card in your hand, which best represents how your body is feeling right now. Point to the part of the image that demonstrates this feeling and pass left when you're finished speaking. Maybe I'll pass to you and then we'll go that way and then we'll begin the proper rounds.",

I was like, Why does it matter at all? But then I tried to find the beauty in statistics, even that I was beforehand, I was shown what type of things it could come from. And so I think at more of a meta level there is this idea of us as humanity having built this concept from practice. Algebra and geometry came from philosophers and mathematicians 2, 000 years ago looking at, on this end, on the size of... Not a computer, but measuring things and realizing that these things could be represented in an abstract manner. In a way that was allowing us to do much more than what we could do with our physical life. And also created this system of very coherent knowledge that is very relaxing to me because of how much we can... I'm going in all the directions, but there is still this meta idea of us having an abstraction of reality that is extremely simple and elegant in a way. And that is representing a really hard complexity in an essence of... With a few axioms. This would be this idea of having just a set of axioms that end up creating this whole universe of rules and objects that interact with one one another in a way that is actually relevant back to our sentient life, which is something that I found quite incredible. And how far maths led us in terms of physics as emerging from us being capable of having more and more sophisticated representation of the complexity of human life and nature. Nature and much more. I did my PhD. In trying to model human behaviors, and we are really at the infancy of such fields. So that was the one, I think. And also there's this relaxing feeling of not having... We know that something is true, which is very frustrating I think for when we work with actually humans, because we don't know that much what is true and what is not true. But it's a field where you have axioms and you can prove things. And there's something I found really relaxing to know that I can know when something is true. Even though this can have limits, of course. There aren't that many theorem that are determinative. But when they are, this feeling of knowing that something is true, is something I find soothing.",

Like the geometry that you can see here, some kind of order that is in the subject, but also which links with nature.

This abstraction that then comes from trying to understand it. And then you think about equations and you begin to invent the language in human terms. So that's the geometry that you can see now, the axioms you're talking about. But trying to synthesize it from nature, and then human beings then thinking about it and then coming up with this well-ordered system of thinking about things and how to prove them. And also seeing them then happening as you're proving. That, Okay, this is actually maybe how things work. So a lot of meditation there, a lot of synthesis and a lot of... What's the word?

I feel like that was lacking in my education before my PhD. I've now come to seek it out more intentionally. I don't know if that's more of a lack of ethics of the people in charge of my education. Maybe it's more of a lack of forethought or something. But yeah, I think that was that. And so I chose this labyrinth because I think creating technology is like you're navigating a labyrinth of the real world and different people that are going to be using it and the different impacts that it's going to have out in the real world.

I picked this one because it's chaotic and ugly and everybody looks fucked up and hallucinating and yelling. And I don't know, I think when I started research I was like, \"Oh, everybody's there for the science and that's what people care about and they're there for making discovery.\" And then I just realized how far it was from the truth when you actually see people in real life. And the fact that they have ego and there's going to be cases of harassment, plagiarism, data stealing. All kind of ego quarrel and like, Oh, I hate this person, not because the science is not sound, because oh yeah, I wanted to be in this position and he took this position and therefore blah, blah, blah, and therefore all the students are shit and I'm [inaudible]. And it was like the aspect of dirty politics out of it was absolutely disgusting for me, and including by the people that I was working for directly and that were leading me. So that was not great. And I don't know how I managed to stay here because I'm still doing research. I think I picked it because I don't think it's that different in a lot of other fields. My brother works for a private company and he also hates his manager. And there is also like, Oh, this person tried to start this project and this person is very abusive to the team and stuff like that. So I just think it's like that everywhere. But at least I knew that when I would be done with my PhD, the level of freedom I would get to would be massive. I could choose which project I work with. And if I don't want to work with that person, well I would not work with that person because now I'm my own researcher and I can decide if I make a project with this person or not.

It was, the more time you spend plotting, skimming, networking, getting money, going on media, getting interview, the less time you can actually do research. Because we have 24 hours per day, so if you spend 70% of your time trying to work on administrative things and recruiting people or firing people or whatever, well you don't read books and you don't dig with the data. And so I realized that actually the more powerful people were powerful in the other positions within the academic capital. But when you talked to them about the topic, they knew very little about it. \"Oh, I read that in Washington Post.\" Okay, cool. And then I realized that there was something that was like the persistence effect. You know, when the star dies, you can still see the light of the star even though the star is actually dead? And I think that's what happened in academia as well. People publish very important papers and books when they're actually young and they're starting their career and they have to get a job and they're still working a lot. And then because people still see the star of what they published 20 years ago, they still think, \"Oh, they're up-to-date with whatever is going on.\" But actually a lot of people don't do that anymore. They published their thing, it's done and they have no idea what's doing on. Maybe it's not the truth, the true in those field, but in a political sense it's very much true. And I always thought that the younger researchers were a bit more curious and interested and still had freshness to them.",

And so for instance, if you take a city, you can hire people that were supporting you with your campaign and you can fire people that were not. And I think precisely, I come from a country where research is mainly publicly sponsored -France. But it was interesting to see for instance, during the debate on Israel-Palestine in Harvard there were donors that were like, \"Oh, you said stuff I don't like, therefore my money will not go to you anymore.\" And for me, that's incredibly dangerous because then it means that at some point you would not be able to criticize billionaires because they're the ones sponsoring the research. And then the same stuff. If actually in order to get money to hire people, you need to spend so much of your time just getting grants, then you don't do research anymore. And then you become something else. You're no longer a researcher for research and science, you're a researcher for money, which is a different type of research. And that means that it's also a different type set of skills that it requires. So it's a bit stupid that you wasted all those years learning about the human body or AI or democracy, because now the only thing you're doing is learning how to get money. But then precisely in term of connecting with the power of things, that gives you so much power because you decide who gets in, who gets out. And so I would be more in favor of a system where it's more public on the one hand, and on the other hand, there would be grants for any level of researcher. And it's the case in Switzerland. I got a grant from Switzerland and they have grants for PhD., they have grants for postdocs, they have grants for early career researchers, they have grants for others. So anybody can apply. I don't need to ask the permission from a guy that's been there for 50 years to. I don't need his support. I can apply for my own project and because it's my project, well, that's my topic. And then they give me the grant or they don't. But I think that's a better model, but I didn't conduct extensive... That's my own experience.",

Once again, I don't know in term of quantities, but one of the logic was... I was trained in the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, the sociology of social reproduction, how an institution or a group reproduces itself. And it's like for a theory, for a professor, it's important that it can reproduce the theory or the paradigm it's working on. So if you're a holist Durkheimian sociologist, well, you want to hire people and train people that are going to be holist Durkheimian people. And anytime you arrive to a problem, it's like, Okay, how can I bend that problem so it fits the frame of being a holist Durkheimian? And therefore it's not so much being open to being wrong or being open to finding something unexpected. It's more like confirming what you already know, it's like confirmation bias. And you're going to judge the other people, especially the people you are going to recruit and train, based on how well they're going to agree with your paradigm or not. And therefore, if you don't look like that, then they put you here or there because you're weird for them. Yeah, that was also surprising.

And for him it was like, \"Hey, it was it's business, it's an industry.\" And I think that's the tension. It's like you try to do art or you try to show knowledge and truth, but at the same time you need to make money and there are people [inaudible]. So I think the tension between art and industry to me is something. And I guess in the U.S. For also the fact that because of the tuition fees are so expensive, it's an industry as well. Getting people to go into college and university and taking money from them. And then they have to get student loans. And it's also a whole thing and you don't want to offend them, so therefore you're like, \"Oh, don't worry. We'll make sure you have a nice experience during those four years. Give us $200,000.\"",

It just matters that you feel something with someone else. And I found that very relatable. And you can start have a conversation really interestingly by being like, \"Yeah, and the house is on stilts. And the stilts are also... Oh my god. And there's waves.\" And you just start to tell stories with it. And I thought that was a really good use of AI because right now AI is not great at being super accurate. And people are like, really, \"How can it be more accurate?\" And I'm like, I think it's wild. It's adding wild things. This is really one of my favorite cards. I think it's so interesting how that one came to be, and it was from a description of someone at the media lab to describe their group, interestingly. And it brought in other things into the image, which it was so cool hearing you say those things that I was like, the AI didn't mean to do that. The person who made this card didn't mean to do that. But now that you're saying it, I'm like, \"Oh, I relate so heavily.\" And I just think that that is the kind of experience I want to make in games, that it's really about group finding group intelligence. And that to me speaks to very interesting agency.",

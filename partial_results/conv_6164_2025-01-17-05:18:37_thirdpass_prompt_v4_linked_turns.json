    "words": "Okay, so really first, purpose of this conversation. So we really want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across different neighborhoods and different communities and really build an ecosystem of listening and trying to find a shared understanding and just creating a more inclusive and stronger Boston. So really to achieve this goal, that's why we invited you all here to engage in a new kind of conversation. So one about sharing personal stories, experiences, observations, things that you've seen maybe in your own lives, in your day to day, and really just focusing the conversation that way. So really we're just trying to build connections and facilitate that conversation for a deeper mutual understanding. And usually this comes through finding common ground on issues with public transportation and stuff like that. Secondly, it's really I want to address what's going to happen to the recording of the conversation. So following this conversation today, the audio recording is going to become a part of a collection of conversations. So this conversation, along with many others, are happening all throughout the city. So Real Talk at Boston is the team that's hosting this that's really manning this and they accumulated a 14 community based organizations, Boston Casa being one of them, and partnered every organization with MIT Center for Constructive Communication. And so really that's where the recording is going to. It's really just being part of a collective understanding of and also in a collection of other conversations that are happening across the city. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the non-profit organization, Cortico. And that's really MIT Center, it's their development arm. And so there it's called a fora system. And so they create a transcript of each recording conversation and that's what we do. We upload the recording and it creates the transcript and it really is meant to highlight common themes across different transcripts. So Jasmine and I go in and we highlight different parts of the conversation where we see major themes or something that's really standing out and it creates a system of keywords and then it creates patterns that way through the system. And then it's really about weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. And so this next part, I do have to say verbatim, so I always say that because it always sounds a little robotic. But as part of this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston and transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection with the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with the mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sessions will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal for foreseen risk. However, with any conversation, there is a chance that you will hear stories that elicit strong emotions. We will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you can only share what you feel comfortable sharing. And then do you consent to this? And if everyone can just come off mute and just say, I agree.",

    "words": "All right. Also, and to say this, we want to make sure we have a chance for everyone to share and we learn from others in this conversation. So we really have a couple of guidelines. So make sure you speak for yourself and out of your experience, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Stay curious if you have questions, ask honest questions, if we pose a question and you need a time to reflect, pause and take that time and listen generously. We assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. If everyone thumbs up if those guidelines sound good. Okay. I'm going to kick us off with the round of introductions. You can share your first name. If you don't feel comfortable using your first name, you can use a pseudonym as well. And so Jasmine and I are, I'll just introduce Jasmine and I. So as the facilitators of this conversation, we're really here just to listen and to just guide the conversation, but really it's all on you all to share your experiences and just jump off of one another and be like, \"Oh, I also agree and I experienced that same thing.\" But if you could share your first name or pseudonym and really just a story about your journey to Boston. So what brought you or your family here, whether that was recently or a long time ago, and what has your experience been like in the overall living in Boston?

The T stops are pretty fairly quick, but it can get challenging. Traffic is unbelievable in East Boston, especially at certain times, but I find that we are lucky that we do have a transit system. There are places that don't have those opportunities and it is easy to walk around once you're in town as well, as I said earlier. So that's transportation.",

I know the mayor does do her coffee talks or whatever in different neighborhoods, which two summers ago I happened to just wander in. She came to a park, I live in South Austin, she came to a park there and that was really nice to see because they had all the different community organizations and they had free coffee and Dunkin' Donuts and the dogs were there and that was a really nice aspect of just feeling like I wasn't there long enough for her when she was actually there, but it was nice to get to interact with all the different community groups and people were there, which was really nice. One thing that I did that's not specific, it's specific to my community, not necessarily support to me was one of, recently this last summer, one of the small shops, like a cute little gift store bottle shop in our neighborhood was robbed during the summer. Somebody came in, took their cash, whatnot, and it got posted on social media and it got shared throughout the neighborhood, all the neighborhood sites and all the different businesses. And we had gone in to see them because we go in there pretty frequently and we had talked to them and they said that they, it was like the day or two after, that they had had the biggest day of sales that they'd had and their history. I think they've been there like three years because everybody in the community was worried about them because they had gotten robbed and obviously, or small business and income could be very tight. And she said everybody in the community came out and when we had gone in there it was jam packed. People were just in there buying things, supporting them, which I thought that was really cool. I think South Boston, at least my experience where I live and the street, is kind of transient, there's a lot of young college kids that live, there's a lot of young people that are moving out. So it can feel not very neighborhoody sometimes, but that was one of the moments where it did feel very supportive community because everybody was coming out to support these small business owners.",

I just saw a friend who's in, I think Sacramento, where they're doing the same thing where they're just going, the city's going in and just basically totally eliminating these sites for unhoused individuals without any support or plans for what they do.

But that is still from a privileged position and I've seen and learned from working in emergency rooms and things like that, how huge of a problem it is for everybody at a lot of different income levels. But especially not having such a basic need, how there's so much like unused space in the city that could be used to provide the most basic needs that would trickle down into them being able to find jobs and be healthier and be a part of the community that they deserve the chance to do. Not just with native Bostonians, but also I've learned a lot about how, this is not my personal experience, but I've had personal experience seeing how this plays out where people who are immigrating, like families and a lot of the political priorities have shifted to not being able to just provide even an emergency shelter.

But we are so blessed with the richness of the culture and the buildings and people just love the details that we have. And so I wouldn't want to really change that even though I know we are going environmentally safe and environmentally structured, but I still think that we need to keep the integrity of our history of our buildings and how beautiful they are and intact. I'm not really sure what I would be looking for, although obviously when we talk about diversity and maybe accessibility for those who have wheelchairs and it's not always easy even though we are getting better, there's buildings that I know that if you're four floors, you don't have elevator but five floors you will. So that doesn't help those that still need to get up the first four floors. And I don't know, we're moving more into virtual rooms too, so cutting back on even going into buildings or even going into offices.

Although I wouldn't be against them redoing city hall, that's probably one building that we could probably redo and be happy about. But we are so blessed with the richness of the culture and the buildings and people just love the details that we have. And so I wouldn't want to really change that even though I know we are going environmentally safe and environmentally structured, but I still think that we need to keep the integrity of our history of our buildings and how beautiful they are and intact. I'm not really sure what I would be looking for, although obviously when we talk about diversity and maybe accessibility for those who have wheelchairs and it's not always easy even though we are getting better, there's buildings that I know that if you're four floors, you don't have elevator but five floors you will. So that doesn't help those that still need to get up the first four floors. And I don't know, we're moving more into virtual rooms too, so cutting back on even going into buildings or even going into offices.

I can't even really have my daughter come visit me because there's really nowhere for visitors to park, let alone residents. So if there's any way to work on parking, I would definitely say the more we build these places, we should be providing parking, whether it's downstairs of a garage, that we need more parking. There's just nowhere to park in the city and I don't think that we should go not having cars.

I've taken public transit and almost entirely in both the cities that I've lived in previously. And it by far is the worst in general here in Boston. It should be accessible. It's a small city, it shouldn't be this difficult. I walk to work two miles every day because I can walk as fast as I could probably get from the red line into work. I don't mind, it's obviously good exercise, but it's silly that it should be a 20-minute ride in. But the times that I've taken it's just been delays and obviously there's delays right now and I know a lot of people, especially if you're living outside of the city trying to get into Boston, it's terrible. So I hope in 10 years that they make it more accessible. I know we won't get rid of cars completely, but I do hope the city makes it easier. I know they're putting in a lot of bike lanes, which come with a lot of mixed feelings about because they do take parking away. But I do hope they invest in some of the infrastructure for people to be able to bike and to take public transit so that we can realistically get away from having cars. I know that it's not possible in the way the city's set up right now to try to be car-free, which is I think where they have to think about.

I do like that they're trying to incorporate all Boston students being able to go to the museums. However, I'm also a grandma and my grandson stays with me on the weekends and I appreciate being able to bring him to the museum. So I'm hoping that they even stretch that out to residents of Boston, meaning that because I'm a resident, I could take my grandson. Now, I do take him and I get the passes of the library. I know they reduced, but I want to say that the children's museum is like $11 a piece. So even having him, I mean I'm certainly not going to go climbing on the things that he does. I'm just basically watching him do that. But I think that they could reduce it for grandmas too. But I want him to get all the culture he can get. It'll be great. But there's so much here to do. I mean, like I said, everyone comes from around the globe. I have friends that are coming from Australia that I'm meeting them tomorrow, where they're going to come visit the Boston. You have to go through the Boston Commons, you have to go through the Gardens, walk the Freedom Trail, and it's all here. It's just all here. But maybe we need to make it even more aware that it's all here. We do because we have the best schools, we have the best hospitals, we have all the restaurants, all the cultures come here. I mean there's a lot of greatness here. We're like the smallest city in the United States, we're like the metropolis. So definitely come to east, they love us.",

The reason why the streets are so small is because those were cows that would go through and make the paths. They're not for two cars along of those streets. I lived in the South end too. I lived in Fenway, I've been in the back bay. We have everything here. Part of it, you got to reach out. But I think that if you plant meeting planners, they should be also explaining that more and sort of giving that more awareness of all that we can do and have and what residents and visitors could do. Even go to the, what is it called? The Cultural Center, Boston Cultural Center, and see what you can see from there. The seaport, it's beautiful there.",

I mean, I think it's always cool to see the way that different people's stories connect with one another and they all start billing off of \"Yeah, I actually know that's also an issue.\" And also bringing in different perspectives. Anna, you were saying like the ER, bringing in another different professions view, different problems in different ways. And I think it's always cool to just have that conversation and see different perspectives on a common issue. So thank you all really for sharing your thoughts, your stories, your experiences and your perspectives. And so just really a reminder of what's going to happen next. Again, the recordings are just transcribed and uploaded to our conversation platform. And it's really just a way for this tool, is a web-based tool for listening and exploring conversations. And that's really what all it's about. And so what I'm going to go ahead and do is drop in the chat our post-conversation survey link. And so if you can all take a couple of minutes to fill that out for us, that would be great. Again, they're all anonymous, I believe. Yeah, so be as honest as you want. Oh wait, forgot the chat. There. Okay. Okay. There's the link. Yeah. And so take the time. You can hop off and do it on your own. You can do it now. But thank you all for participating and sharing and it was great to hear your perspectives. And I hope to also send out at some point whenever we wrap up this project, the end results of what your participation means. And so I will be in touch via email when that happens down the road.",

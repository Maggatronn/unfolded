I'm going to choose this one, which is this picture of someone in a very cozy bed, which looks to be in a van and has a bunch of different books in the back and the backpack around the city. I'm choosing this for a couple of reasons. One is because I lived in a basement studio, which was not really a studio, but it was just an illegal tiny micro unit that my landlord created to be in the style of a tiny house. And so I literally had this... My bedroom was this small cubby area, which only had enough room for the bed and the bed would lift and you could put storage under it and around the sides were these bookshelves. And I lived in a house with folks who were in the graduate program the year above me. They were in my same program, but they were just in second years and we would hang out every night and we were really cool. We were all Black or descended from Africa, so we really connected in that way, but they were really distracting and it was hard to... I would be so tempted to just sit up with them and talk and hang out until 1:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning and not really get work done. So when I realized that, \"Oh shit, I feel like I'm not getting a lot done,\" and that's why I would retreat to my dungeon or basement studio and really hunker down.

They just want to say what they want to say. They don't want to be understood. They don't want to really understand the other person. They just think, \"Okay, I'm right. How am I going to get across that I'm right?\" But they're not even thinking about how the other person will interpret it. It's just like, \"What do I want to say? Okay, I will say that.\" There's just a lot of people sort of yelling what they want say without really any end goal in sight or any sort of collaborative process to get to some sort of decision. Because I do like debating a lot, but I don't like debating because I like just yelling at people. I like it because I like trying to understand where the other person's coming from and trying to get my point across in a way that makes sense to them and understanding how they will communicate and how I can get through to them, or being able to recognize when maybe I'm in the wrong or they have a good point, which is...

I guess the first image makes me think about housing or war. The third one makes me think of trash and climate change and also food waste. And I guess I'm not as sure about the second one, but it sort of makes me think about mental health. I guess I would say, I guess I'll pick the middle one because I feel like a lot of these issues can be really hard to discuss and can bring up personal experiences for people that might be really stressful or painful. I feel like since mental health is something that's extremely personal to people who... Like, a lot of people have mental health struggles and then it can be really hard to share things that affected you personally with other people. So I think that's something that can be harder to discuss with larger groups or in a setting that applies to the whole institution of MIT. But also, I think that, for example, discussions about Israel and Palestine can get really heated and for issues like housing insecurity or food insecurity, probably we could be doing more to address those problems and to help people who are facing those problems. I'm also not super well-informed on a lot of things that are happening on campus. Who picked this one? What were you guys thinking about when you put these down?",

It didn't seem like there were many spaces that allowed you to engage without being aligned to a particular movement or org. And then on the flip side, from a housing and houselessness perspective, most people, most people, broadly agree that folks shouldn't be houseless or not have homes, but where and how houseless people are served is often such a huge, huge conflict or an issue that's riddled with conflict. So I don't know how much we get into that on campus necessarily, but I think it's kind of a taboo topic because... Yeah, I think it can be a taboo topic to think about because we're in an ivory tower and the housing insecurities that students might face here are a little different than the type of housing insecurities one might face on the outside. Not all, obviously, but in general, I think the framing is a little different when students are thinking about or talking about housing than people who don't have a housing department that they can go and complain to or talk to or try to get aid from to find housing.",

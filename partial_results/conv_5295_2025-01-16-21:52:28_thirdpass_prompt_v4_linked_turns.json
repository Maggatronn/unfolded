I don't think there was a hall kitchen. It was slated to be demolished like two years later. So we were all having a great time in the building. And so I get there, I set up my stuff. My roommate has not yet arrived, but at some point he does walk in the door and I have just never had anything less in common with anyone my entire life. We exchanged two sentences that entire year, and one of them was about how there was a bad smell in the hallway. He just didn't talk at all. So it's sort of like a weird ante story in that we were just coexisting in this space, but not really interacting at all. Got very awkward. At one point he sexiled me with his new girlfriend.",

    "words": "All right. Let's go for burrow. Let's give it a whirl, hey? Okay. So which roommate did you find the most challenging to live with? What dynamics made it so tough? Yeah, so I've lived with some interesting people. I think before I moved here I lived with, there's someone, there's one story in this that's just kind of a crazy person that's fun. And there is one that was truly a difficult person to live with and I'll straddle both a little bit. But before I moved here, I lived with this artist and he was a total tortured artist, like the first person I could honestly say was a tortured artist, because he would shoot analog film and then he would also do analog music making. And he would spend thousands of dollars to basically collect all the physical equipment you need to have an at-home studio. And as soon as it was done, he would completely switch his interest to film and he would just undulate back and forth with these hobbies that are so immensely expensive and space-consuming, which was really interesting living with this person during COVID, because our laundry room was also a photo processing room and stuff like that. But I think I'll switch off of him, because he was also really great. He was just super crazy. But I think a person that I truly had a hard time living with, was my first roommate that I moved here with. I lived with three others. And this person was a germophobe. And I thought from the beginning like, oh, that's okay, clean. I like to be clean, I'm cool with that. But it actually turned out that they were very messy. What they were afraid of was they were germophobe in terms of OCD, so they wouldn't touch the handle if I had touched it. So they would grab toilet paper and twist the handle, but then they kind of lacked the ability to take after themselves and just kind of lacked general hygiene things. It's an old Cambridge house, mold had grew behind the toilet and it was just routinely me after me, after me doing that, taking out the garbage. I really felt like his mom. I really, really felt like his mom in the sense that, wow, there's a lot going in. And I had to even over accommodate. I was like, well, we're roommates now and I want this person to feel at home. So if they're a germophobe and have OCD, I'll try my best to make it accommodating for them. So we had one hook for my towel and one hook for his towel in the washroom, and we shared a washroom. That's like a locus of a lot of this, right? But so many of the things, the garbage would always pile up. He would keep his laundry in the washroom. Such a presence, just kept such a presence in the shared space that completely was kind of contrary to what I thought a germophobe would've been. Anyway, so what this turned out to was someone that had quite a bit of tyranny over shared spaces, both the living room, they had their own pots and pans that you couldn't use, but didn't sort, so you kind of had to play guesswork. It does come down to just a lack of communication in some ways, but it was a really, and myself and my three other roommates, my two other roommates all had a bit of a sticking point with this person and me personally, I didn't, it never really reached a extreme for me, but one of my other roommates and him threatened to fight to the death.",

There's no having to guess what the image might be at the end that starts to introduce human versus AI interpretation of something, and I think that's less interesting, right?

Sometimes I wasn't sure exactly how much does what I do here really impact the later on of the game. And I think maybe the situation we're in, we're all really willing participants in this kind of study setting, so we really want to make it work. But sometimes I also feel like kind of the shooting hoops, if you have an actual objective to go at, it kind of distracts you from that. It's a little bit weird and awkward, and sometimes that can be a good thing to actually have some sort of, I don't really know how I'm putting that.

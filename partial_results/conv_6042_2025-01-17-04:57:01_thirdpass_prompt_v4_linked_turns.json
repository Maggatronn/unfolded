    "words": "Okay. First is the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across neighborhoods and communities and build an ecosystem of listening where every community member's story contributes to our shared understanding in a stronger, more inclusive Boston. To achieve this goal, we invite you to engage in a new kind of conversation, one centered on sharing personal stories from our own lives and experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. This approach aims to help build connections and facilitate conversations that deepen mutual understanding. Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation. Following our meeting today, the audio recording will become part of a collection of conversations. This conversation, along with all the other conversations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk at Boston team, which consists of 14 community-based organizations in the city of Boston and the MIT Center for Constructive Communication. Thirdly, all conversations that will be part of this effort will become part of the conversation platform that is developed by the non-profit organization, Cortico CCC's Development arm. The FORA system creates a transcript for each record conversation and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerges across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets and discover patterns. What we want to accomplish today is to be in the process of weaving a virtual tapestry of conversations across the city. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the MIT Center for Constructive Communication to retain the recording of this conversation in accordance with the mission of the Real Talk at Boston and transforming Boston into a listening city. You also understand that the conversation will be part of the Real Talk at Boston Public Conversation Collection. With the goal to foster constructive conversations across the city. CCC will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that goal and with that mission to develop methods and tools that foster constructive communication in local communities. Participation in this conversation is voluntary and you can withdraw any time without consequences. Sections will be recorded, but you can opt out and have this recording deleted. Only the research team at the MIT CCC will have access to your data. Your identity will be protected and information won't be shared without permission unless required by law. There are minimal foreseen risk. However, as with any conversation, there is a chance that you'll hear stories that elicit strong emotions. I will support you in hosting a safe conversation where you only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Do you consent to this? If you agree to this, if you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.",

Lastly, we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and learn from others in this conversation and to support these goals, we'll introduce a few guidelines for our conversation. One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Four, stay curious. Ask honest questions. Five, pause, take time for reflection. Six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact.

And I know that they've tried to cut down on Ubers. I think Ubers make up 50% of all the traffic. They're trying to cut down and increase costs, so less people take them, but it's like that's not solving really the issue. The issue is it's so expensive here that people are either moving out because of work or just simply can't afford it, but they still work here and have to get here somehow.

And that really, again, that tool is just for listening and exploring these conversations. And I'll go ahead and send the link as well for the survey. Does anyone have any last minute thoughts or questions? Perfect. Okay.",

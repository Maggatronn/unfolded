This is just kind of a happier image, and this is that crowded case. And I'm kind of feeling that there's a relationship between this crowded, boxy, no one's really doing anything fun, everyone's just existing in the same space together, and this picture, where it's just too much, there's just too much stuff going on. And when people talk about history, when they talk about they're nostalgic for a time, they're talking about a time when there's fundamentally just less people. Right? Because it's like the problem now is there's a population problem. It's just how do we have more people in the same space? And so that to me is this tension because it's just like, \"Okay, we have to juggle more.\" You know what I mean? But why I think this is a resolution is because I think that there's wisdom within what was known at that time when it was less stressful that now it's so stressful, all we can look at is these frustrations. But I don't know, I think that it wasn't about getting around, it was about getting to somewhere specifically you were trying to connect with people via music. Now it just feels like people are talking about just how to get to work. You know what I mean? We don't have space to talk about, well, I'm just trying to get to a place where I can find like-minded individuals who will play music that I like. It's like we don't associate those issues together. And so I guess the resolution I'm kind of thinking about is there some type of reframe or refocus to be less about getting from A to B and more about what is the cultural pieces and what is the excited energy that people have, that people used to have, that they're nostalgic for? What if there was just more cultural things around in different areas? You know what I mean? Maybe that solves or draws away from the need for it to be always about function.

And so I know that also came up in the conversations, like that is a whole thing where it's like I wish, we used to have more spaces, green spaces and things that we could just go to, and now it's like, it feels like that's not there anymore.

But if you were to compare, I think, the number of times where you would feel sort of normatively responsible for holding the door open versus normatively responsible for not trying to be the last car in the intersection just before the light is going to turn red, you end up blocking the traffic that's coming from the other way, those two are fundamentally the same kind of thing.

And so this one here, overlooked potential, this is actually about someone losing their job because of disability. And that's a really horrible thing, but even in that story, they say, \"You know what? That kind of motivates me to think about this in a different way.\" Because that tension and that thing that kind of sucky happened to them, they're empowered. And they say that in their story. And it says empowerment, loss, and important notice. I don't know. But one of those is like that. And so that kind of is my connection here that I think the things that cause us tension are the things that can actually give us that spark.

How do we feel? It's almost like feeling love and happiness and energy to the fullest potential to the fullest extent, because you know it came from something that was very hard. And I think that it almost brings a level of appreciation almost, right? And so this is why it's always people are like, \"Oh, I don't regret this bad experience, or this is what made me who I am, and through this I'm able to find this spark. I'm able to find this passion because I know what that felt like.\" And so it's almost like the ton of cliche, like changing a negative into a positive. And so I definitely deeply resonate with that too, where it's like it can show how, through all this and through, let's say this person, but you're bringing together a lot of people and it's a very powerful just momentum of energy, and that's how we all live our lives and how that's a perfect way of thinking about life too.

I'd first say, I'm not a communist, I'm not a socialist, but at the same time we have a tremendous distribution of wealth that's much wider than it used to be. And there is that reality of there are a lot more bedrooms in this community that are empty than there are people who need homes. So, there is a real problem that's created when you do have that kind of wealth distribution. That happens anywhere. And I moved here ... I won't get into that. The question is ... The reality is we can throw money at the solution and that can help, but there is this other reality of we, as a community, can learn to live differently in a way that's more supportive. I live in a neighborhood in Redmond, that's a pretty old neighborhood, so everybody knows everybody. We know of the homeless people, their people grew up in the neighborhood, they just had mental difficulties of various sorts. So they come around, and people, they give them their cans, or give them money, or they talk to them, and they sometimes stay at their, when it's really cold, at someone's house. But if there is that kind of small neighborhood attitude ... We even have a neighbor who just sets out a cooler, refreshes it every day. It's just free food. So the kids who walk by, or sometimes people just totally drive over there and get food. So, as a culture, how do we ... Really, it's a cultural problem, and it's at its deepest level, and in terms of policy, it always seems to be talked down directed. But what can be done, at a large ... to be more influential and create, it's not just awareness, but how do we ... It's funny, it's like there's this thing that happens when a small community lives isolated from the rest of the world. Everybody tends to do okay, but when there's a huge influx, it changes the relationships between people. So is there anything that can be done, on a policy level, that can help us, like you're saying, partner with other organizations to help.",

She was expecting her second child and then because of medical reasons had to go through an abortion. And because of the restrictive legal procedures there, she and her family had to be in pain for over 48 hours. And there was indecision around how to move around this issue. So not only was it harmful for her health, but clearly the outcome was going to be a negative one. And that's where, yes, there are a lot of issues around housing, around cost of living, but the positive side to it, as you said, at least we have access to healthcare, which we may not in other places.

Would you walk away from this job? Do you even have that option to walk away from this job because it's getting to a point that's hard to bear? And yet the resources are so limited. So something on the mental health space that I saw first-hand is, again, as a society, we're very readily prescribed medication as opposed to invest in the community care support structures that might be more beneficial long term. And so to me that's really the question, is what are we doing in terms of our priorities and values? If you ask people, everybody wants to be cared for. Everybody wants that sort of support. Yet as Social Workers, as mental health care workers, I think we're also familiar that the investment that's needed is just not there. And I think time is part of it because people are looking for shortcuts. People are looking for ways to quickly make the big bucks. And with all of the distractions in our life, it's really hard to give these things that are important to the time they need. That's my perspective on that.",

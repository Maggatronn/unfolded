    "words": "Okay, we are recording. Good morning everybody. Thank you so much for participating in the Storytellers Project, sponsored by an organization called Cortico and the New York City Department of Health. My name is David [Surname] and I work with the Borough Park Jewish Community Council on their COVID Disparities grant. So why are we here? We're here because the pandemic is now actually almost, we're approaching it the three year anniversary in March. And, wow, that's really a long time, and yourselves, I'm sure have really struggled and countered and managed to get through the pandemic and we're probably very deeply affected by it. The sponsors of this activity, and I share this belief as well, is that really to understand something you have to talk to the people most directly affected. That means the citizens of our city who... Everyone has a story to tell, an important story that we can learn a lot from regarding just so many different parts of this whole COVID pandemic experience. So that's what we're going to do today. We're going to just have some questions and you're just going to freely talk about your experiences. Nothing to be nervous about, just talk about what happened to you. And that will be very, very meaningful for this project and for others to hear, to listen. Your responses are being recorded and they will go into a library with hundreds of others and people, I don't know what they're calling it, the voices of COVID or people speak about COVID, but I'm sure it'll be very interesting to stakeholders and getting a deeper understanding of really how people were affected by COVID. So I'm going to read a consent statement that's part of this procedure and so that everybody's on the same page and you signed your consent form. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the New York City Public Health Corp to use the recording in accordance with its mission. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. Okay. I just have to get that business out of the way. I'm wondering if I should sit closer. Just not taking any chances. [inaudible] Just a little closer. You all are really close. So our first activity is everyone just go around and introduce yourself and there's a little exercise called PIES, P I E S, where you just talk about something. It could be physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually what you're feeling today. So that's just what they call it, an icebreaker. That's the new, you always have to have an icebreaker. So when you start a meeting... And also say, I agree. I agree, when you're done introducing that you agree to participate and you heard the reading, the sentence I just read.",

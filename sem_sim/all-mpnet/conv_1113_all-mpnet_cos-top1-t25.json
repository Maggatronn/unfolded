Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation, and I have begun recording. I'm just going to go over some things, just some key ground rules. Just to speak for yourself, and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Stay curious, pause, listen generously, and also stay present. I just want to make sure everyone's onboard with these guidelines, we just shared in the large group, and if there's anything you would like to add or change. Okay, perfect. Now we'll move on to some introductory questions, and to make this conversation a little bit easier, in the beginning, we'll use a modified circle.

So, we're just going to ask if you would share your first name, your gender pronouns if you're comfortable doing so, and also, in addition, just share a little bit of background info about who you are and a value that's important to you. I'll go first. My name's Anna. My pronouns are she, her, hers. A value that's important to me is honesty. I really value people being honest and wanting to share their ... Just what they think. I think it just makes it a lot easier and a lot better. This value relates to the community and why I'm here today, because where would I be if people weren't honest? I feel like you can only get so far, and if people aren't truthful, then you're just being held back in the past, and you're not really present, in the moment.

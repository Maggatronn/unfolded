Healthcare providers not listening. My third pregnancy, I think I was nine weeks or something like that and I had this really bad pain. I called urban care, came in like \"Oh, it's probably nothing, you're fine.\" I was like, \"No, this is different, this is my third pregnancy, I know something is wrong.\" Still didn't do anything. Then I went to my doctor, I think it was a week later. She was like, \"Oh, no, everything is fine.\" I ended up going to the E.R. one night just because the pain was so bad, it was in a weird place and so. They did the test where they test your HCG and it's supposed to double every 24 hours, whatever. It was double, and said \"Oh no, you're fine. I'm like \"No, I need an ultrasound.\" Something is not right. Finally, I got ultrasound a couple days later and they found that I was pregnant with twins and one of the eggs or whatever embryos was in my fallopian tube and it was on the verge of exploding, so I had to have an emergency DNC to get it out. The thing was it took two weeks. I switched doctors after that. It was crazy because my doctor's like, \"Oh no, you're fine, don't worry about it.\" I'm like, \"No, this is my third pregnancy. I know something is wrong,\" but they just don't believe you. I think especially with black women, there's this notion of, and there's studies that have proved this, that they think that we have a higher pain tolerance or we're out to get some sort of drug or something and so we're faking this. It's just very frustrating because I could have died and there have many women that have died as a result of something similar because the healthcare provider's not listening. I also think there's this misconception that in Wisconsin that the reason why the infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are high is because something about lack of healthcare. It's not about the lack of healthcare. We all have access to healthcare. It's just when we go to the healthcare providers, we're not listened to. Then that prevents people from going because if the doctor's not listening to you, you're not going to want to go back, and then that's why we don't get care. It's not because we don't have access to it. There's just this misconception I think that people just automatically assume why things are happening and don't realize the innate racism that's occurring out the healthcare system."}}},"49":{"words":"I guess mines a little different.

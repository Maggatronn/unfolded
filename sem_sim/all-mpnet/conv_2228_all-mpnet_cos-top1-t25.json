{"1":{"words":"Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I'll have you guys do introductions in just a minute or two after I read the introduction that we have. So welcome to this conversation on Cortico's Local Voices Network sponsored by Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a way for Mainers to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the direction of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth and people and in major Maine industries. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we uplift the voices and the needs of the whole state, every county in order to build a healthier public sphere. And education of course is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing your personal stories from your lived experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. Following the conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education Action Forum of Maine and you will receive an email following this conversation, giving you access to the recording as well as all of the other recordings that have been part of this project. What you say will be publicly available but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. So please introduce yourself only with your first name and your role. Of course, you can introduce yourself with your last name if you want to, but typically we're asking people to do first name. And we have a little agreement to be recorded that I'm going to read. And after I read it, if you all agree, if you could say I agree, that would be great. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Education Action Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use the recording in accordance with the mission of Maine ED 2050. The mission of Maine ED 2050 is to bring communities, educators, and youth together to discuss how education and schooling can be designed together for personal, civic and economic thriving in the next few decades. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Local Voices Network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve or understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain, and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.","link_turn_id":["NA"],"speaker_turn":1,"speaker_name":"Fiona","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":0.0,"end_time":170.412,"segments":{}},"2":{"words":"I agree.","link_turn_id":["NA"],"speaker_turn":2,"speaker_name":"Libby","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":171.3,"end_time":172.395,"segments":{}},"3":{"words":"I agree.","link_turn_id":[2],"speaker_turn":3,"speaker_name":"Julianne","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":172.547,"end_time":173.49,"segments":{"2":{"segment_words":"I agree.","link_turn_id":2,"score":1.0000001,"linked_words":"I agree."}}},"4":{"words":"I agree.","link_turn_id":[2],"speaker_turn":4,"speaker_name":"Kristel","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":173.49,"end_time":173.657,"segments":{"2":{"segment_words":"I agree.","link_turn_id":2,"score":1.0,"linked_words":"I agree."}}},"5":{"words":"Fantastic.

To be totally honest, I have not yet had the opportunity to meaningfully dig into that. We have another survey for that coming up in spring of 2023. And between those two pieces, I think that's going to be very telling for us on where our young people are at. With the pandemic and the light that has been on mental health, I feel like there was a really big opportunity for positive change to happen. And as people have re-acclimated in, whether we call this the ongoing pandemic, post pandemic or whatever language it is that each person is using these days, I feel like as we've started to return to the sense of \"normal\", we're starting to see a pullback from understanding of youth mental health already, unfortunately. I think that the drive is there for more people to have that knowledge, awareness, and desire to do better. But I'm starting to see systems pulling back and trying to refocus on two things that were more traditionally a focus like with schools being pulled back to focusing solely on their standards. Whereas previously, maybe the administration would have supported more education around mental health for their staff. And unfortunately as a state, as a whole New England area as probably a whole country, we don't have a mental health system that is super functional yet. And I think that, that's something that is on a positive track or I'm hopeful that it is. But with the way that our system is set up right now, it is very reactive and we don't have enough providers. And the ones that we do have are working their hardest in doing their absolute best. And I am so grateful to them. But we look around the state and we see wait lists that are out of control. I hear about folks that have been on waiting lists for over a year for some services. And it's not that anyone's doing anything wrong, there's just not enough. And I think that how we move forward from this space right now is going to be very telling for what things are going to look like over the next couple decades. We're in a position to have legislature reevaluate where reimbursement rates are for Medicaid across the state. For insurance companies, on what kind of responsibility they have to serving people with mental health needs. How accessible that can be to people is unfortunately tied to financial status. If people don't have insurance or don't have access to Medicaid, that's not a feasible option for folks to be accessing ongoing professional support more often than not. And even those that do have access to those insurance coverage is not always ideal. And people are limited by having to have a specific diagnosis, often, diagnosis often that would provide them a prepackaged treatment plan often, it feels like. And again, that's not on the providers, I see that as an insurance problem that is directly impacting the care for not only our young people, but people at large. And I think that as we see this younger generation come up to voting age and being able to be more civically involved, I am hopeful that we're going to see some larger systemic changes that's going to impact really everyone's access to mental health services supports and the way that we view mental health, to be able to have it as an ongoing, open, honest conversation. Not this thing that gets swept back under the rug because we've returned to what we believe to be normalcy. So I'm always optimistic that we're headed in a better direction, but also realistic in that our system is not perfect. The individuals that are in it are trying and working their best, and I appreciate that to no end, but we always have room for growth and improvement."}}},"53":{"words":"We have a wonderful upstream suicide prevention program that we're working to get into as many Maine schools as possible.

It could cause them to feel like they're being rejected even though that's not really what's happening. So those things can butt heads in ways that are not what we want to be seeing, but hopefully there will be things in place in the future that might mitigate some of those issues with resources that we have in our system at the moment. And then to add on to another thing that I see, other factors playing roles in youth mental health is the conversations that youth are seeing on the political national level. It has a very big impact, and particularly in this moment, thinking about like the LGBTQ community. Consistently, studies have shown over the years that they are disproportionately affected at higher rates where they're experiencing depression and they're having suicidal thoughts more often. I believe that the rates in the MHSS data that came out recently is that for LGBTQ individuals, it's around 40%. That shifts depending on which group we're looking at. But 40% I think is the lowest number of those groups. And so when we're then seeing conversations on a national level where there's pushback against having conversations in schools, then that's affecting those youth because it's affecting their safety at school, which should be a safe place for them. So that's just one example I think of many that we could pull out, but that is one factor that immediately came to mind for me."}}},"56":{"words":"Yeah.","link_turn_id":["NA"],"speaker_turn":56,"speaker_name":"Fiona","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":2327.125,"end_time":2327.887,"segments":{}},"57":{"words":"And so-","link_turn_id":["NA"],"speaker_turn":57,"speaker_name":"Kristel","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":2333.725,"end_time":2334.041706,"segments":{}},"58":{"words":"Oh, were you saying something?","link_turn_id":[56],"speaker_turn":58,"speaker_name":"Fiona","conversation_id":2228,"start_time":2334.041706,"end_time":2334.054331,"segments":{"56":{"segment_words":"Oh, were you saying something?","link_turn_id":56,"score":0.34426492,"linked_words":"Yeah."}}},"59":{"words":"As an aside with the technology piece, this has been such a great opportunity these last couple of years to be able to see people have the opportunity to use technology for their benefit of learning more and engaging in different ways.

I think that when we have young people that have been shown that they can rely on the adults in their lives and that their peers have been a positive support, that shows them that they have community and that it's okay to ask for help and that doesn't make them weak or less than, but rather can shift that into being a strength to be able to have our young people not feel that they have to carry the weight of the world on their own, but rather it's a shared process.

As a quick add-on to that, I think of recently, Libby and I met with a group of students that were expressing some frustrations with the culture at their school that there was a culture of physical violence at this school and they were worried about how the school was responding or not responding. And they took it upon themself to put together these flyers, posters that they wanted to put up around the school to encourage communication. And it was done in such a respectful manner. It was very accessible in the way that they were designed. It was wonderful to see a young person take it upon themselves to do something like that, to essentially make an action plan and want to follow through on it.

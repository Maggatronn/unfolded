Welcome to this conversation hosted by me, myself, Chauntia [Surname], and our technology partner, the Local Voices Network. Thanks for joining us. Here's our plan for the next 75 to 90 minutes. We'll be going over a few details about this project, establishing some conversations, guidelines, introducing ourselves, and then moving into a conversation. We share our vision and experience around community engagement in Durham. We're focusing this conversation and experience of residents of Braggtown area. I have begun recording at this time, and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. There are three reasons we are having this conversation today. We want to create change based on our experience. We want to make sure that our voices are elevated beyond the moment of conversation itself. And we want to better inform how the city invests money for equitable and green infrastructures. And what that means is that we are all tired of doing surveys, don't speak directly to us, to town meetings, answering surveys, and a lot don't get answered, so basically, that is what to create change base is about.

You just brought up a couple minutes ago how the roads used to be so bad and now they're fixing the roads. But here's the thing, I've only been here for a year, but when I got here... wait, I know y'all lived there your whole life. But here's thing. Miss Vanessa came up and took everybody on a bus tour to show them how bad it was. I had to sit down and was having meetings with them for a whole year and a half and then all of a sudden it got done. They found the money, we made enough of a stink and it got taken care of. I don't know what people did before me. I can't say nothing about that. But I can say something has happened in the year that I've been here, where there's been some results. Even just the fact that Chauntia, you are here and you've done a program, this didn't exist. Community partners didn't exist three years ago. And that's something brand new, because we got some people who want to shake up some stuff and said they wanted to do something and had an idea on how to spend the money instead of just waiting to find out. So there is a change. The thing is... it's slow, but that doesn't mean that it's not possible. So I want us to really talk about it being possible, because who knows, I could mess around, bump into the city manager tomorrow and have a long conversation and really tug on some heart stringss and then all of a sudden we able to get whatever we want. I don't know. But I don't want us to approach the conversation and be like, it's never going to happen, because I have seen stuff happen. I've sat at those tables with Sean Egen from the transportation department and said, Hey, we need money to do this, because nothing happened and there's a bunch of complaints in that area. And we've done it specifically for Braggtown. Other areas have not gotten as much stuff in the past two, three years as Braggtown has. So I just want to encourage you all to say that it is possible. Is it going to be the way we want it?

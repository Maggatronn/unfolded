The first one, speak for yourself and on your own experiences, not others. I'll allow others to speak for themselves. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, take turns, allow others to finish speaking. Number four, stay curious, ask honest questions. I should be seeing head nods throughout this entire thing, preferably. Number five, pause. Take time for reflection. Number six, listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Number seven?",

So in one person's experiment they asked ChatGPT to write a poem about Joe Biden and ChatGPT therefore wrote a poem about Joe Biden. And then preceedingly, the user asked ChatGPT to write a poem about Donald Trump and ChatGPT responded saying, \"I will avoid this prompt considering it's most likely politically incorrect.\" Something along those lines to avoid any controversy. This created a huge issue on the internet where people were fighting and people were saying, \"ChatGPT is biased, ChatGPT is all the way on the left.\" And after a while ChatGPT developers came out and said, \"this is a mistake on our part.

But I don't think it does a great job at hooking someone. And however, if I watched two, three minutes into it, I definitely think I would've watched into the end. What would've made me enjoy it more? Like I said, a super vibrant hook at the beginning in the first 30, 15 seconds is what really gets a lot of people, considering attention spans are dipping exponentially. You need to have a really good hook. And this unfortunately did not have the greatest hook in my opinion, of course. I didn't really find anything confusing. The beginning was a little bit boring, but nothing really was confusing for me. I think it did a really good job of explaining who everyone and why they were in the documentary. Would I share? I think I 100% would. I think Frontline did a really good job of creating the emotional difference between two people.

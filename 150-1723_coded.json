Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine are the co-sponsors of Maine Education 2050, and we're grateful for your participation. There are three main purposes for the conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the directions of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth, and people in the major Maine industries. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier published sphere, and education is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. One that I think you all are used to having, actually, if you work through consensus. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the LVN collection, Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education ACTION Forum of Maine, and you'll receive an email following in the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available, but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. I will ask you to do that in a minute. As a participant in the conversation, you're providing consent to Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use this recording in accordance with the mission of Maine Education 2050. You also understand that the conversation will be a part of a collection at Cortico's Local Voices Network. This mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect and retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree."

Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine are the co-sponsors of Maine Education 2050, and we're grateful for your participation. There are three main purposes for the conversation. First, we want to create a new way for community members to listen and learn about each other's experiences, values, and perspectives, especially around education. Second, we want to gather voices from around the state to inform the directions of Maine's educational system. We have conversations for community members, educators, youth, and people in the major Maine industries. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the whole state, every county, in order to build a healthier published sphere, and education is a critical part of that. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. One that I think you all are used to having, actually, if you work through consensus. These conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the LVN collection, Local Voices Network collection. The data is owned by Education ACTION Forum of Maine, and you'll receive an email following in the conversation, giving you access to it as well. What you say will be publicly available, but only publicly identifiable by how you introduce yourself. I will ask you to do that in a minute. As a participant in the conversation, you're providing consent to Education ACTION Forum of Maine and Educate Maine to use this recording in accordance with the mission of Maine Education 2050. You also understand that the conversation will be a part of a collection at Cortico's Local Voices Network. This mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect and retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree."

Just we ask that you feel free to pick up on each other's threads and pull them into what you have to say, so feel free to do that. Share fully and leave time for everyone to participate, and then listen openly and ask questions when you want to know more about what someone else has said. I think those are all things you're familiar with in this group. We're going to use a modified circle process, which really just means that we will go around in a circle, so to speak, a Zoom circle, to make sure that everyone has a chance to either say pass or to add something, but when we are doing that, feel free again, to pick up on things other people have said, and then once everyone has had a chance, if you want to come back, we can certainly then have it be a little bit more generative. All right. And then I'm going to put this in the chat just so you have it there. All right, we're going start by I'm going to ask you to share your first name, the county and the town that you live in, your profession, and what you feel makes a thriving, resilient community. And we can start with whoever feels moved to go first, and then I might just ask the next person to pop in and the next person. Someone has a cute dog."

For them to share what they see and what they know, that we all have our own experience and it's all we have, but when we have an opportunity to hear how someone else sees in a different way, and it's open and free for them to voice that, that's as strong and powerful as the community can be.

And she came in with one of the things that she was supposed to do was get parents more involved. And so she started with a parent group like a PTA and then quickly, and I joined that, folks realize that, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We don't have students on this committee and we don't have faculty and staff on this committee. We quickly shifted it to a school climate committee. And one of the things that Kristen suggested was that, okay, this is not me being the person in charge. What about if we had a school chair, a parent chair and a student chair who formed a leadership team for the group? And that's what we did. And it remained that way until a new principal disbanded the organization for whatever reason, but I just really think that those kind of opportunities for parents, faculty, staff and students to work together in making change in their own little school community, it was very powerful because teachers listened to the students. It wasn't just the principal saying we got to do this. We want to have a school climate week, not just a school climate day, we want do training to staff on accepting and welcoming folks with different gender identities and sexual orientation and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That was very powerful. A lot of stuff was done in the four years that we were all together with that committee. I haven't heard of anything like that happening elsewhere. I may be wrong, I'm not connected throughout the state for sure, but I know there are multiple opportunities in some schools for faculty, staff and at least students to work together on affecting change, all the civil rights teams in particular and schools that have a gay, straight, trans Alliance or something like that where youth are really put in a position to be leaders and to not just what the advisor comes up with."

And as far as a thriving community, I feel that if we had jobs around for everyone, that would be helping for the thriving part. I think also it's very important to have support for everyone, not just a few. You have to look at all the margins of life, too. You have to try to see beyond what you see as a picture of the person, see to more the inner person than the outside as to where they're from, their ethnic background, what color or anything. Just try to see who the person is inside all that, and that's the important part and to be supportive of all of us all. Get along, that would be a wonderful part. Can we just all get along? That would be great. That's all."

And if so, how over your time living there? And then next kind of connecting that to, do you see it continuing to change over the next 30 years, per se? I can say it again.

And she came in with one of the things that she was supposed to do was get parents more involved. And so she started with a parent group like a PTA and then quickly, and I joined that, folks realize that, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We don't have students on this committee and we don't have faculty and staff on this committee. We quickly shifted it to a school climate committee. And one of the things that Kristen suggested was that, okay, this is not me being the person in charge. What about if we had a school chair, a parent chair and a student chair who formed a leadership team for the group? And that's what we did. And it remained that way until a new principal disbanded the organization for whatever reason, but I just really think that those kind of opportunities for parents, faculty, staff and students to work together in making change in their own little school community, it was very powerful because teachers listened to the students. It wasn't just the principal saying we got to do this. We want to have a school climate week, not just a school climate day, we want do training to staff on accepting and welcoming folks with different gender identities and sexual orientation and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That was very powerful. A lot of stuff was done in the four years that we were all together with that committee. I haven't heard of anything like that happening elsewhere. I may be wrong, I'm not connected throughout the state for sure, but I know there are multiple opportunities in some schools for faculty, staff and at least students to work together on affecting change, all the civil rights teams in particular and schools that have a gay, straight, trans Alliance or something like that where youth are really put in a position to be leaders and to not just what the advisor comes up with."

And she came in with one of the things that she was supposed to do was get parents more involved. And so she started with a parent group like a PTA and then quickly, and I joined that, folks realize that, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We don't have students on this committee and we don't have faculty and staff on this committee. We quickly shifted it to a school climate committee. And one of the things that Kristen suggested was that, okay, this is not me being the person in charge. What about if we had a school chair, a parent chair and a student chair who formed a leadership team for the group? And that's what we did. And it remained that way until a new principal disbanded the organization for whatever reason, but I just really think that those kind of opportunities for parents, faculty, staff and students to work together in making change in their own little school community, it was very powerful because teachers listened to the students. It wasn't just the principal saying we got to do this. We want to have a school climate week, not just a school climate day, we want do training to staff on accepting and welcoming folks with different gender identities and sexual orientation and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That was very powerful. A lot of stuff was done in the four years that we were all together with that committee. I haven't heard of anything like that happening elsewhere. I may be wrong, I'm not connected throughout the state for sure, but I know there are multiple opportunities in some schools for faculty, staff and at least students to work together on affecting change, all the civil rights teams in particular and schools that have a gay, straight, trans Alliance or something like that where youth are really put in a position to be leaders and to not just what the advisor comes up with."

And actually the vision was hugely powerful that more than one mayor in the next 25 years brought that vision out at their inaugurations because it talked about working together, collaborating, acting as a region, as a service center, as a people. Well, I would say most people would say 20, 25 mile radius around. That brought China and that brought lots of little towns in. And if you go... You're talking about a meeting, I once went to a meeting and walked in and one of the leaders of the community said, uh-oh Faye's here, now we're going to have to collaborate. And everybody laughed, but that's basically the most powerful thing that came out of that meeting was everybody was now, and I think enjoying the fact that they could and it was now okay and it was part of how we were to do things, to join hands and work together. Because there's nothing more exciting than being on a winning team and we all felt that that's what we were building. There was a real excitement about that. I think that was the biggest change I saw. And if you were in that community now, absolutely collaboration is the thing. There are tests that we need to meet, COVID didn't help, COVID didn't help at all. Because now all of the individual pieces are being tested to their extremes. That makes it difficult for... One of the biggest things that the community voted for, and the votes was for a lay department store called Sterns. One of the biggest things, they were hoping that Colby would come off the hill, be more part of the community because everybody sensed a lot of the answers, knowledge, et cetera, exist there. Now Colby has come off the hill in a way that nobody, not even Colby, believe me, especially not Colby at that time envisioned. That big change in a time of COVID is really a challenge for our community. I have every thought and every feeling in my heart that when that is all over and well and we're back to healthy again, it will be one of our greatest pride and joys, but change, even small changes for individuals are difficult. And this is such a huge change coming from, just imagine now difficult it is for Colby to be doing this and then having COVID hit right in the middle of all their investments and all their work. And instead of having a hotel, you have to put kids up in your hotel. For everybody, it's really hard, and I'm just praying that when it dies down, it'll be peace in the valley."

And actually the vision was hugely powerful that more than one mayor in the next 25 years brought that vision out at their inaugurations because it talked about working together, collaborating, acting as a region, as a service center, as a people. Well, I would say most people would say 20, 25 mile radius around. That brought China and that brought lots of little towns in. And if you go... You're talking about a meeting, I once went to a meeting and walked in and one of the leaders of the community said, uh-oh Faye's here, now we're going to have to collaborate. And everybody laughed, but that's basically the most powerful thing that came out of that meeting was everybody was now, and I think enjoying the fact that they could and it was now okay and it was part of how we were to do things, to join hands and work together. Because there's nothing more exciting than being on a winning team and we all felt that that's what we were building. There was a real excitement about that. I think that was the biggest change I saw. And if you were in that community now, absolutely collaboration is the thing. There are tests that we need to meet, COVID didn't help, COVID didn't help at all. Because now all of the individual pieces are being tested to their extremes. That makes it difficult for... One of the biggest things that the community voted for, and the votes was for a lay department store called Sterns. One of the biggest things, they were hoping that Colby would come off the hill, be more part of the community because everybody sensed a lot of the answers, knowledge, et cetera, exist there. Now Colby has come off the hill in a way that nobody, not even Colby, believe me, especially not Colby at that time envisioned. That big change in a time of COVID is really a challenge for our community. I have every thought and every feeling in my heart that when that is all over and well and we're back to healthy again, it will be one of our greatest pride and joys, but change, even small changes for individuals are difficult. And this is such a huge change coming from, just imagine now difficult it is for Colby to be doing this and then having COVID hit right in the middle of all their investments and all their work. And instead of having a hotel, you have to put kids up in your hotel. For everybody, it's really hard, and I'm just praying that when it dies down, it'll be peace in the valley."

And then I gradually became involved in what was happening, and then as my empty nest happened the same year that REM was born, I was absolutely totally 100% involved in REM. And so as I watched it grow, it was a very, I don't know what the right word is, but the fences around the towns were up pretty high. Waterville did Waterville winds, Rome did Roman whenever the neighbors didn't speak much. As part of the visioning that the people, about 250 people wrote over a three day community catalyst that REM brought to start and birth REM, which we didn't know we were doing at the time.

                    "transcript": "Well, I came here in 72 from Rockville, Maryland. This community was brand new to me. When I was raising my children, I was very insular living out in China with Waterville being my service center. And then I gradually became involved in what was happening, and then as my empty nest happened the same year that REM was born, I was absolutely totally 100% involved in REM. And so as I watched it grow, it was a very, I don't know what the right word is, but the fences around the towns were up pretty high. Waterville did Waterville winds, Rome did Roman whenever the neighbors didn't speak much. As part of the visioning that the people, about 250 people wrote over a three day community catalyst that REM brought to start and birth REM, which we didn't know we were doing at the time. We thought we were just bringing community together to create a vision and some teams where they could work. And actually the vision was hugely powerful that more than one mayor in the next 25 years brought that vision out at their inaugurations because it talked about working together, collaborating, acting as a region, as a service center, as a people. Well, I would say most people would say 20, 25 mile radius around. That brought China and that brought lots of little towns in. And if you go... You're talking about a meeting, I once went to a meeting and walked in and one of the leaders of the community said, uh-oh Faye's here, now we're going to have to collaborate. And everybody laughed, but that's basically the most powerful thing that came out of that meeting was everybody was now, and I think enjoying the fact that they could and it was now okay and it was part of how we were to do things, to join hands and work together. Because there's nothing more exciting than being on a winning team and we all felt that that's what we were building. There was a real excitement about that. I think that was the biggest change I saw. And if you were in that community now, absolutely collaboration is the thing. There are tests that we need to meet, COVID didn't help, COVID didn't help at all. Because now all of the individual pieces are being tested to their extremes. That makes it difficult for... One of the biggest things that the community voted for, and the votes was for a lay department store called Sterns. One of the biggest things, they were hoping that Colby would come off the hill, be more part of the community because everybody sensed a lot of the answers, knowledge, et cetera, exist there. Now Colby has come off the hill in a way that nobody, not even Colby, believe me, especially not Colby at that time envisioned. That big change in a time of COVID is really a challenge for our community. I have every thought and every feeling in my heart that when that is all over and well and we're back to healthy again, it will be one of our greatest pride and joys, but change, even small changes for individuals are difficult. And this is such a huge change coming from, just imagine now difficult it is for Colby to be doing this and then having COVID hit right in the middle of all their investments and all their work. And instead of having a hotel, you have to put kids up in your hotel. For everybody, it's really hard, and I'm just praying that when it dies down, it'll be peace in the valley."

And we moved here after our kids were through the school system so I didn't have the school system to pull me into the community, which is a huge help. I just jumped right into the community. I met Faye and got involved with REM and that was about it. Boy, everything from there, that touches everything, so many different organizations. And I got involved with a lot of different nonprofits around helping all those, too. That was a busy part. I have found it a very interesting place, there's lots to do here, you can get involved with it. If you just try, you can find things to get involved with. And I've got involved with different ones, my church is involved in an essentials closet they've started up recently where they hand out items to people and that's just a wonderful thing that's there and it's a needed thing. That's there and it's a needed thing. It's wonderful. These kinds of things that people in the area say, Hey, we need this and someone does it. It's very nice. I'm tempted to say that this is the way life should be right here in Maine and I'm quite happy with it. Seeing all the involvement with the colleges in the town, I think that's the good thing. I love to see bringing the students in working with this, I'd like to see more of that. That's great. That's about all."

Considering that, now think ahead a little bit and imagine where your community is going, where it might be in the next few decades, and what will sustain it to kind of make it the Waterville area that you would like it to be. Considering that, what makes a good community member? One who helps the community be its best. What does that community member look like in the coming decades?

I think about folks who are going to take the risk to pull people together. I think about folks who are going to be really grounded in the value of everybody's voice is important, and maybe my biggest job is to make sure everybody's voice is heard. And I think about folks, and this is one of my fears about where the education system might be headed. I'll frame it in that context. I worry about, over the last few decades, the increasing focus on knowledge meeting the learning results in Maine, whenever those first came out. And perhaps fewer opportunities for students to engage in democratic consensus building activities, taking risks to be part of that, or to be a leader in that. And I worry about if youth don't have that experience during their school life, how are they going to be effective collaborative consensus building community members in the future, whether they're in a leadership role or not. Yeah. Yeah, so I think folks got to listen first, listen actively, and engage folks in the discussion and creatively together think of opportunities. Okay, you all want to do this?

And we moved here after our kids were through the school system so I didn't have the school system to pull me into the community, which is a huge help. I just jumped right into the community. I met Faye and got involved with REM and that was about it. Boy, everything from there, that touches everything, so many different organizations. And I got involved with a lot of different nonprofits around helping all those, too. That was a busy part. I have found it a very interesting place, there's lots to do here, you can get involved with it. If you just try, you can find things to get involved with. And I've got involved with different ones, my church is involved in an essentials closet they've started up recently where they hand out items to people and that's just a wonderful thing that's there and it's a needed thing. That's there and it's a needed thing. It's wonderful. These kinds of things that people in the area say, Hey, we need this and someone does it. It's very nice. I'm tempted to say that this is the way life should be right here in Maine and I'm quite happy with it. Seeing all the involvement with the colleges in the town, I think that's the good thing. I love to see bringing the students in working with this, I'd like to see more of that. That's great. That's about all."

They mentioned COVID, there are all sorts of other things, how the world has changed since the last 20 years. Considering that, now think ahead a little bit and imagine where your community is going, where it might be in the next few decades, and what will sustain it to kind of make it the Waterville area that you would like it to be. Considering that, what makes a good community member? One who helps the community be its best. What does that community member look like in the coming decades? You've alluded to this quite a bit, but you could be as specific as you want. Mark, would you, when you're ready, jump in, feel free to pause and take time to think of things."

When I think about an effective community member, I think about someone, and there may be different attributes that folks have, different ways that are effective, but for example, what Jackie talked about. Just getting involved in REM, in the essentials closet, she also works on meals for folks when that's the only chance to get to eat that day, but I think about somebody who's going to take the risk to do that. I think about folks who are going to take the risk to pull people together. I think about folks who are going to be really grounded in the value of everybody's voice is important, and maybe my biggest job is to make sure everybody's voice is heard. And I think about folks, and this is one of my fears about where the education system might be headed. I'll frame it in that context. I worry about, over the last few decades, the increasing focus on knowledge meeting the learning results in Maine, whenever those first came out. And perhaps fewer opportunities for students to engage in democratic consensus building activities, taking risks to be part of that, or to be a leader in that. And I worry about if youth don't have that experience during their school life, how are they going to be effective collaborative consensus building community members in the future, whether they're in a leadership role or not. Yeah. Yeah, so I think folks got to listen first, listen actively, and engage folks in the discussion and creatively together think of opportunities. Okay, you all want to do this? How are we going to get it done? Who can help us? What resource do we need? All those kind of things."

I don't know how many people would even know because I still get people who are like, you've been here 20 years, where have I been? I think one of our biggest things is we get so lost in feeding people and creating safe places for women who've been hurt. And for having REM robotics teams out competing, all these things take your focus, but if you don't take the time to let people know you're even there, you're hurting your people instead of helping them. I think we need to use the multitude of media that we have and take time to develop that communication so that people know. And so that they have a good way to connect so that it's clear. We are in our fundraising time right now, and we'll probably do a pretty sloppy job of it because we'll be out doing other things, but we need to stop and we need to really look. And you're talking about a diversity of people. I can remember working days on a leaflet and handing it to someone, and she sat there and read it, wanted to please me and do what I asked for. And she looked at me and put it on the table and said, I can honestly say, I do not know one thing that was written in this. Understand that we talk about the diversity and then we use a word like consensus building. How do you, and this gets to my second most important part that I've learned in this time. Many times we take something like people who need food and we decide, we, the eaters, we, the growers, we, the producers say, okay, this is how we're going to get those people food. Where are the people who need the food in that decision or setting up that process? I learned that from Women, Work, and Community many, many years ago right at the beginning where I know I'm like, oh, I'm at the middle of this. I don't know anything, what am I going to do? And I went to Susan [Aline], who has since passed, at Women, Work, and Community and started to learn. And that was one of their biggest lessons was that the people who were involved in the problem need to be involved in this solution. Otherwise, you're going to be less than you could be. That would be my thing to make sure that everybody who is involved is in part of the solution."

I think about folks who are going to be really grounded in the value of everybody's voice is important, and maybe my biggest job is to make sure everybody's voice is heard.

I worry about, over the last few decades, the increasing focus on knowledge meeting the learning results in Maine, whenever those first came out. And perhaps fewer opportunities for students to engage in democratic consensus building activities, taking risks to be part of that, or to be a leader in that. And I worry about if youth don't have that experience during their school life, how are they going to be effective collaborative consensus building community members in the future, whether they're in a leadership role or not. Yeah. Yeah, so I think folks got to listen first, listen actively, and engage folks in the discussion and creatively together think of opportunities. Okay, you all want to do this?

It decides whether that child is going think of himself as a person in the world with something to say in a place that's safe to say it, that's what he needs to start and she needs to start. And that's the big first steps. Early childhood education for the parents and for the children, it must be as a unit because they are a unit. I think that's the most important thing to me, I learned that so places in my life, I taught special ed and learned that it's just how they learn to get along with others and how they feel about themselves. Any issues that are making fun of each other or harassment of any kind, I think every teacher should have antenna out for any of that behavior and have it known that it just is totally unacceptable. As teachers teaching teachers to welcome the diversity and make big deals out of the positivity of it, to keep it a positive thing not a negative. He's different, so therefore let's make fun of him. And I just saw something yesterday, I've been watching a lot of TV because I'm in a bed, what can you do, right? It was a show about them having mock trials in school. There's one girl who wasn't even going to go to college or anything that this woman saw in her when she was doing a mock trial for fun, that this girl really has a mind and she's really smart. She goes out of her way to convince the parents that this young woman could be an excellent attorney. And of course in the story it works out that way in the end. I know it doesn't always, but part of the community vision says that we are all family. And I think that that's a really important place. If you're all family and a family your next door neighbor is having trouble because drugs or whatever, right. And there's a million holes to fall in, that you are part of that family and that you'll say you want to come over and have some cookies with me? I've got this great puzzle I thought you might enjoy. To make real friends with your neighbors, and the closest person you can help is the closest person to you. Thinking of ourselves as family and that's a responsibility, that's not just something we do for fun to make ourselves feel good. That's a responsibility to look around you and see when a child is being hurt or whatever, and doing what you can to make it better. I think those would be my two things, playing well in the sandbox and letting yourself go to say we are all family."

I know it doesn't always, but part of the community vision says that we are all family. And I think that that's a really important place. If you're all family and a family your next door neighbor is having trouble because drugs or whatever, right. And there's a million holes to fall in, that you are part of that family and that you'll say you want to come over and have some cookies with me? I've got this great puzzle I thought you might enjoy. To make real friends with your neighbors, and the closest person you can help is the closest person to you. Thinking of ourselves as family and that's a responsibility, that's not just something we do for fun to make ourselves feel good. That's a responsibility to look around you and see when a child is being hurt or whatever, and doing what you can to make it better. I think those would be my two things, playing well in the sandbox and letting yourself go to say we are all family."

She goes out of her way to convince the parents that this young woman could be an excellent attorney. And of course in the story it works out that way in the end. I know it doesn't always, but part of the community vision says that we are all family. And I think that that's a really important place. If you're all family and a family your next door neighbor is having trouble because drugs or whatever, right. And there's a million holes to fall in, that you are part of that family and that you'll say you want to come over and have some cookies with me? I've got this great puzzle I thought you might enjoy. To make real friends with your neighbors, and the closest person you can help is the closest person to you. Thinking of ourselves as family and that's a responsibility, that's not just something we do for fun to make ourselves feel good. That's a responsibility to look around you and see when a child is being hurt or whatever, and doing what you can to make it better. I think those would be my two things, playing well in the sandbox and letting yourself go to say we are all family."

The courses, the technology part that we're coming up with now, everyone's got to have that, but that's probably a given.

That they have a time for folks who identify as part of the queer community to meet together in a safe group, but they also have a mechanism for the folks around those people to meet and share there \"Oh my God, my kid just came out, now what do I do?\" Or \"My kids getting bullied at school because somebody outed them at school. What do I do?\" I think that... To recognize that, it doesn't necessarily have to be the school who has that kind of group, although it's great if they have a variety of groups, but the community, like Alfond did, is they probably saw a need for this. Not every kid at the Waterville Senior High School is going to want to go to the GSTA at that high school because in effect they're outing themselves if they don't want to do that as being queer or as being an ally.

What are some ways that those kinds of experiences or skills, capacities could be had or built? The things that you were just talking about, the collaboration and the working together and the awareness of community, this feeling of family, welcoming diversity, all these things that you've said. What are some good ways for those experiences and capacities to be built? What are some good ways to have that happen, but also kind of at the same time, does schooling or more broadly, education, need to respond or evolve in a new way to develop those core capacities that you're talking about? And if so, what might that look like? Because maybe there are ways for those things to happen. Maybe this isn't at school, the things that you're talking about, but maybe it is from your perspective.

That they have a time for folks who identify as part of the queer community to meet together in a safe group, but they also have a mechanism for the folks around those people to meet and share there \"Oh my God, my kid just came out, now what do I do?\" Or \"My kids getting bullied at school because somebody outed them at school. What do I do?\" I think that... To recognize that, it doesn't necessarily have to be the school who has that kind of group, although it's great if they have a variety of groups, but the community, like Alfond did, is they probably saw a need for this. Not every kid at the Waterville Senior High School is going to want to go to the GSTA at that high school because in effect they're outing themselves if they don't want to do that as being queer or as being an ally.

And I think it would take the community coming in and giving the time. I've always wanted REM to work and I've talked with Educare about it and they were more than open to it, but finding the energy and the thing to make that link between all parents, not just the ones lucky enough to be working every day with Educare.

I got the mother who was the bartender, I got them, and I had 100% every time. I think anybody and that class could have helped make that happen.

You can talk generally so you don't have to identify your child, you can say, what if a child is having this? And then the parents can all talk about ways that they've gotten around that because there isn't anything that happens to one that hasn't happened to all the others as well. Somehow linking of in conversation. Doing what we're doing here today, just think of how beautiful this is and that we can do this. And 20 years ago we were going what? Not even imagining it. I think we need to use our tools and think about them and no matter how poor somebody is, their kids will have phones or texting or whatever. And if not, fix that.

And I've always had a secret, I don't know how secret it would be. I don't have any secrets from Jackie, so probably can't call it a secret, but I think that the work that's being done at Educare benefits a group of kids, a group of people, but because of the world that we know now and the capacities we have for social media communication, I think we're not doing nearly enough. And I think it would take the community coming in and giving the time. I've always wanted REM to work and I've talked with Educare about it and they were more than open to it, but finding the energy and the thing to make that link between all parents, not just the ones lucky enough to be working every day with Educare. But take a camera in with a teacher who has a really neat lesson for the day and just sit there and tape it and then put it on the REM library. And name it so that when your child's having trouble with X, getting along in the sandbox, you could just watch that and take that into your own parents library and have that for yourself. That would be my dream to link. When I taught special ed, they gave an award, you got ice cream to the whole glass who had the biggest, I always had 100% because I get we and got them. I got the mother who was the bartender, I got them, and I had 100% every time. I think anybody and that class could have helped make that happen. My classes were 10 kids, so no problem, but getting the families and the parents to be more of the process so that we link it. You can talk generally so you don't have to identify your child, you can say, what if a child is having this?

They talked about having the community or the town or whatever the governmental or municipal sector was to make sure the young people were on it. That if it's the water district decisions, because I think the more you have people involved in making those decisions, the more understanding they are about how difficult it is to come to really great answers because there are so many factors that make those simple decisions not simple. Having the children be part of those, knowing that sewage is an issue in a community or whatever. All the other, the roads and whatever direction the road's going to be. And I remember there was one of the people in REM from the very beginning, he had two children and he never showed up at a REM discussion without those kids. And I think parents need to think of that when they go out to be part of a group or to a discussion, or to try to come up with some better anything, the kids be included like you would when you went on a family vacation or you went to church or you did your thing to have them be valued by you, the parent, as a thinking, rational human being capable of having great ideas. I think we haven't talked about the family, that the word family was talked about a lot. I think part of it is challenging families to be families, to be one unit, to think of themselves as that. And that means that the children are thinking of themselves as part of the unit with responsibilities and for that community as well."

And I think not just that, but I think participating in those kinds of things engages people in expressing themselves in different ways. Maybe they take risks if they're part of a play, they're part of a group that needs to figure things out. I remember back when my daughter was in high school as part of Waterville, this is a very specific story. They had an awesome, awesome strength program that kids would start in fourth grade playing violin, cello, viola, and do it personally all stayed until they graduated because the teacher was just so awesome. And there were, I don't know, two, 300 people involved in that every year. And I knew that for my daughter, it was a great confidence builder, a great common goal to work with the orchestra to put on these different plays throughout the year. I just wanted to throw that out there as something that I wish that... Schools have school bands, but Waterville was the only one I knew of certainly at that time that had a specific, very strong strength program."

They talked about having the community or the town or whatever the governmental or municipal sector was to make sure the young people were on it. That if it's the water district decisions, because I think the more you have people involved in making those decisions, the more understanding they are about how difficult it is to come to really great answers because there are so many factors that make those simple decisions not simple. Having the children be part of those, knowing that sewage is an issue in a community or whatever. All the other, the roads and whatever direction the road's going to be. And I remember there was one of the people in REM from the very beginning, he had two children and he never showed up at a REM discussion without those kids. And I think parents need to think of that when they go out to be part of a group or to a discussion, or to try to come up with some better anything, the kids be included like you would when you went on a family vacation or you went to church or you did your thing to have them be valued by you, the parent, as a thinking, rational human being capable of having great ideas. I think we haven't talked about the family, that the word family was talked about a lot. I think part of it is challenging families to be families, to be one unit, to think of themselves as that. And that means that the children are thinking of themselves as part of the unit with responsibilities and for that community as well."

And that through those experiences, perhaps they'll also develop by looking and learning, but also by participating, how to work collaboratively with other people and to see the value in listening to other people's voices. And yeah, I think that's a really, really wonderful vision. The last specific question is actually very specific. And so the question is what is the highest value of K12 education to your community? Sometimes people put that question as what's the purpose, but I feel you could also think of it from the perspective of what is its highest value to your community? If this school were to disappear tomorrow, oh no, what would be the biggest hole? Another way to look at it."

They're not even in interested in the sandbox. I guess my main thing would be that they came through, people could though have an average six to eight careers in their lifetime so that they might go back to school, I have friends who go back to school at age 80 because they want to do something right. I think that's very important that we look at it as this is a place where you learn to be a human. Kids come home from school, say what happened today? And the things that they don't tell you have nothing to do with any of the five subjects they had. They had things that happened to them, people who said things, people were doing things, that's really what their learning and what they're churning in their heads. It's that process where we learn to go with this particular mass of people to become a person and the experience you have there. Just making that environment as challenging and exciting and demanding and all those things as possible. I would say that my feeling is not you go there to get a job, that's just a little teeny piece of it because that's going to work out on the other end, forced by the fact that you just put a diamond ring on somebody's finger. And so you got to be thinking and hopefully the school made it so that it's not a last minute decision that you've made progress and everybody made sure you were making progress and supported you in every way they could, but I thought about something I wanted to add here. We've talked about the little kids in the sandbox, and a lot of this, to me, is about 50 years from now. And so I'm thinking I'm 76, I got four more really productive years according to the stats, and I'm thinking how important it is to get the young kids and the older kids together. We're going to be starting a lifelong learning center. We had this thing we call a chat, so the civic engagement go far civic engagement piece under the leadership of Elizabeth [Surname] sort of took the chat, which was it an hour and a half hour? Hour, Jackie? And you chat on something, one girl chatted on her vases, that she studied vases. Another person did it on writing pen pals with one of the nursing homes. They just took them and ran with them. Now, we're sitting here looking at these faces. There was this young face of a girl talking about the importance of restorative justice with about 10 or 15 people, 65 and older, and how close they were and how they loved conversing and learning from each other. The one who did the restorative justice piece ended up on our board where she's now in college. I'm sorry about my phone, it's rude. And she's down in Cambridge and she's on our board for REM. I'm just saying we have every way in the world now to put those groups together. We should just be doing it in every way we think possible so that there's so much to learn from the kids who are in the sandbox. And there's so much to go where in the other way, for us to share with them. Or the sandbox is still Colby college students, to me. When you're 76, they're in the sandbox."

They're not even in interested in the sandbox. I guess my main thing would be that they came through, people could though have an average six to eight careers in their lifetime so that they might go back to school, I have friends who go back to school at age 80 because they want to do something right. I think that's very important that we look at it as this is a place where you learn to be a human. Kids come home from school, say what happened today? And the things that they don't tell you have nothing to do with any of the five subjects they had. They had things that happened to them, people who said things, people were doing things, that's really what their learning and what they're churning in their heads. It's that process where we learn to go with this particular mass of people to become a person and the experience you have there. Just making that environment as challenging and exciting and demanding and all those things as possible. I would say that my feeling is not you go there to get a job, that's just a little teeny piece of it because that's going to work out on the other end, forced by the fact that you just put a diamond ring on somebody's finger. And so you got to be thinking and hopefully the school made it so that it's not a last minute decision that you've made progress and everybody made sure you were making progress and supported you in every way they could, but I thought about something I wanted to add here. We've talked about the little kids in the sandbox, and a lot of this, to me, is about 50 years from now. And so I'm thinking I'm 76, I got four more really productive years according to the stats, and I'm thinking how important it is to get the young kids and the older kids together. We're going to be starting a lifelong learning center. We had this thing we call a chat, so the civic engagement go far civic engagement piece under the leadership of Elizabeth [Surname] sort of took the chat, which was it an hour and a half hour? Hour, Jackie? And you chat on something, one girl chatted on her vases, that she studied vases. Another person did it on writing pen pals with one of the nursing homes. They just took them and ran with them. Now, we're sitting here looking at these faces. There was this young face of a girl talking about the importance of restorative justice with about 10 or 15 people, 65 and older, and how close they were and how they loved conversing and learning from each other. The one who did the restorative justice piece ended up on our board where she's now in college. I'm sorry about my phone, it's rude. And she's down in Cambridge and she's on our board for REM. I'm just saying we have every way in the world now to put those groups together. We should just be doing it in every way we think possible so that there's so much to learn from the kids who are in the sandbox. And there's so much to go where in the other way, for us to share with them. Or the sandbox is still Colby college students, to me. When you're 76, they're in the sandbox."

I think Suyash will be sharing out a survey for how this felt as a tool. But as you know, our small group of people can't possibly represent everyone's point of view. We're not perfectly representative of the demographics of MIT or the perspectives across the university. So one of our students offered the tool, the empty chair, which stands in to represent perspectives that we haven't covered yet and might want to consider. So I selected Luis Martinez. I'll give you his background. And again, this is an AI generated Persona. So he's 45, a man, income level is medium, education is some college, and he works As a facility manager. Politically he leans moderate and his sustainability interest is kind of medium in his little bio. Luis Martinez is a facilities manager at a neighboring college in Boston. He grew up in a working class family in Puerto Rico and moved to the mainland US for better opportunities. After working in various maintenance roles, he now oversees the sustainability initiatives on his campus, focusing on practical and cost effective solutions. Luis values hard work and responsibility, and while he understands the importance of sustainability, he often weighs these initiatives against budget constraints and practical feasibility. He believes in incremental changes that balance sustainability sustainability goals with other operational needs. This is a lot of text. He believes. Although he is not in direct affiliation with mit, he's interested in their approach to sustainability as successful programs could inform his strategies at work. And so he's been listening and has reflection. So yeah, some points of disagreement and some missing perspectives. So would you like to read the points of disagreement?",

      "words": "Thanks. I can read through the background stuff quick. So she's a lifelong resident of Boston and runs a local diner that has been in her family for generations. Her perspective on sustainability is rooted in practicality and economic survival with slim profit margins. Emily is often skeptical of new sustainability projects unless they provide clear economic benefits. She believes these initiatives can sometimes overlook the immediate needs of businesses operating within tight budgets. While not an opponent of sustainability, Emily prioritizes keeping her business afloat and questions how sweeping changes at institutions like MIT might impact local communities and small business businesses economically. So points of disagreement. She noticed a lot of discussion around climate education and student led sustainability, which in theory sounds good, but leaves her wondering how it addresses the immediate financial concerns of people like her. The emphasis on climate justice and net zero emissions can feel a bit abstract when you're dealing with the day to day realities. These discussions often overlook the ground realities of local businesses having to adapt to sudden change which sometimes feel imposed. She wishes there was more skepticism about the economic implications for community businesses which shouldn't be burdened by standards that could jeopardize their livelihood. Her missing perspectives are. What's notably absent from the conversation is the viewpoint of a small local business and the potential financial strain that these policies might create. I don't hear much talk about what MIT sustainability policies mean for surrounding neighborhoods and small enterprises having to adjust to changes. They champion local voices and their economic conditions should be a core part of these conversations. We need practical solutions that bridge the gap between high minded academic goals and the financial realities we face every day. It would be useful to discuss how college towns can better support small businesses as part partners rather than viewing sustainability as a top down directive.",

And also like, I feel like historically that's kind of been the role that we've been serving as well, which is just putting information out there. Like, I think I, like I always think back to when I was applying to MIT. I listened to a speech by Dr. Langer and he was talking about the Human Genome Project and it was really, really great because I think one line that he said, I kind of, I'm going to paraphrase right now, but he was saying that, you know, it's our job as scientists to put all the information out there because when everybody has access to these resources, when everybody has access to knowledge, we all win. I thought that was so powerful to me and I still think like that is the role that MIT should continue to serve as well in the future.

Because I think what I like, briefly talked about in the conversation was that, like, a lot of people Blame the LA Fire Department and the government for not doing enough preparation for this series of incidents. But the thing is, I was listening to a podcast about essentially, like, historically, like LA always expects wildfires single year. It happens every single year. And like almost always, it's always controlled. Like, for example, I think like just last month the fire department went through the entire city, checked every single water tank and made sure that they were all functional. So they've done preparations just like they always have before. So, like, I feel like we should be focusing on what went wrong this time. And on top of, you know, budget allocations and things like that. A bigger problem is the fact that we are experiencing global warming. We are experiencing drier seasons. Louisiana is drier than ever. And, you know, that's why we had two huge wildfires at the same time. And we just got a new one this week, which is great. So it's always a continuous process to not only think about the short term effects of what our government can do, but also long term effects of how our planet is actually changing and we have to change with it.",

I mean, I don't know how familiar you guys are, but I'm also from Texas and a lot of kids, like my sister's nine years older and a lot of kids from Louisiana ended up moving to Texas because anyway, they ended up coming and they just. So they didn't have enough time to evacuate. And then a lot of the people who weren't able to about evacuate were people who didn't have access to transportation, things like that. And then on top of that, they created some shelter spaces. I don't know if you guys know what the Superdome is in New Orleans. It's like this big football stadium that they have. So they had like 20,000 people stay in there, but it was not equipped for 20,000 people to stay in there for as long as they did. I think they had enough supplies for 10,000 people.

They're kind of like literally probably whatever happens, we're not gonna get support even unconsciously. I think they do believe that.

But when that trickles down, I know that there's a term for it, and I don't know what that term is something else, but it's where they're just essentially just out allocating civic responsibility downwards into smaller and smaller groups. And when it comes down to our government and trying to do something about it, they then, you know, they then put it out for interest groups to, you know, actually take action on their own. And oftentimes when it trickles down so much, a lot of the actual groups that can implement real changes in real time aren't given enough resources and like, you know, financial support in order to make like to implement whatever proposals that they have. So I think kind of like adding on to what you said earlier is that it shouldn't even be a political issue to begin with. This is an issue that affects everybody equally. I guess not equally, the working class a little more, but everybody would be affected by this issue. But in terms of, I think like, not only for government but also for like various industries that are involved with the process, they need to stop pushing away responsibility to other people and take that on as, you know, a part of their mission and just I guess create a pathway to divert from, divert from these unsustainable practices.",

      "words": "One of the proposals that I wrote out in my pre conversation survey, pre survey was the idea of creating a more. I think I talked about this in our last conversation, creating a more activist investor based culture in financial investing. So this is kind of on the rise. Like an example we Southwest Airlines, so previously they've had a huge like business turnover turmoil because essentially like a long story short is that a lot of activist investors took over the company and they tried to change up the entire board. They tried to swap out a bunch of people on the executive board. And under the idea that they hoped that Southwest Airlines could essentially be a greener company and promote less carbon emissions in terms of all of their flights. So they were trying to change the infrastructure from the inside out. So on the investor side, I guess on the financial side, a lot of people thought this was a crazy outcome idea because Southwest Airlines was doing pretty decent. I guess before and essentially with the addition of all of these, like, trying to combine sustainability values along with business, they were thinking that it's very unproductive and. But if we look at where Southwest Airlines is now, they're actually valued at like the top two airline stocks like that are the most valuable, like as of right now in Korea, current day. So I think kind of like essentially in our last conversation, we were also talking about how, like, students at MIT will probably graduate and go on to have, you know, very successful careers and very different goals wherever they go. And a big part of it would come back to the decisions that they choose to make on their career paths, as well as what they choose to invest their time and resources in the future. So if, like from education, I guess it always comes back to education is if we create kind of a model of educating MIT students to become better informed on these different issues and also kind of cultivate them into adopting these values, I guess making these values a more integrative part of their lives than in the future. When it's their turn to be the decision makers, they would be sure to pivot towards those values instead of just thinking about financial gains, which would hopefully make some meaningful change. And yeah, I think that that is probably the most tangible way that we could start. I think it's very difficult to all of a sudden kind of scrap the whole idea of choosing marginal financial gains over that of. Wait, I'm sorry, I'm wording it wrong, but choosing, I guess choosing climate, like choosing to do something about climate change versus that of financial gains, it would be very much more difficult to do that in the short term. So I think this might be like a longer term issue and we need to think of a longer term solution.",

And Iran has its own problems, but they are able to fund education and like subsidize a lot of things through having nationally owned oil supplies. It's almost thinking about, it's almost just as Important for Iranians to buy into switching from fossil fuels or have backup solutions.

And essentially their whole goal is teaching like financial literacy and I think a bunch of different curriculum to kind of younger children who might not have the resources to learn about it. And honestly I think like starting from the. These people who are passionate about educating on these issues and also making sure that young people have what they need in order to go into the world and make real change and also be able to not have to live in terrible conditions as well. Just have what they need to just have what they need in order to live comfortably as well. It really has to start with people who, who kind of already have the authority to do something and people who already have the power and resources to actually take action. So I think it's about motivating these people to implement something based off of what they already have. Which is always, I feel like the hardest part, which is everybody has every.

I know you guys gave me some a free requisite of this conversation, but what did you think of the pan know on a scale of 1 to 10? 10 being extremely informative and one being that was unhelpful or more confused than ever.

Essentially what he told me was that it's always difficult to coordinate with the government because it's always difficult to get anything on the agenda. So instead, everything that is happening here at MIT and with the cities is through their own actions and not necessarily through a delegate representing us somewhere.

I will put solar panels on my house when I buy a house. But I think this was very enlightening in a sense that we hear about actual initiatives are actually taking place right now, as well as how we can be shaped into it. I'm not sure if you guys saw the map that Joe drew on the whiteboard. I really recommend you guys take a look. Essentially, he created this diagram of essentially three major stakeholders in the world and how they communicate with each other. And the communication is not what we think it's like. Engineers don't just directly talk to people in governance and people in finance, and talk to them directly about what they're engineering, what they're designing. Instead, they send out people who work in operations to talk to them. So essentially, the leaders in the different stakeholder circles essentially get together, and that's how we get actual coordination between different groups. And so I thought that was really nice to hear about how, you know, after graduation, for example, whichever sector that we choose to work in, whether it be engineering or something, in leadership or something even, you know, I like full disclosure. I'm planning on probably selling out to finance, and I really didn't know what, like, how climate change actually fits into it. But hearing about it, I think it's like he shaped it in a way that I think the narrative is all of us can contribute to it collectively. Everybody has a role in it. The way that we can look at the issue is essentially how we communicate with other groups in order to have something actually be implemented. So I thought it was very good to look at.",

And while I agree it's good to have, you know, a sort of soft deadline as to how, like, when certain initiatives need to happen, I agree more with Joe, which is the deadline matters less and more about actually putting action in place. And so I don't know if we are the people, but I think everybody should at least start thinking about, like thinking more consciously about how all of our decisions actually factor into what our future could look like and what it can come down to, lifestyle as well as mindset, as well as to how our future is actually shaped and how we can change our day to day philosophy to kind of help shape that.",

Part of the like, conversation I felt was missing, like, specifically like, I low income, like I'm a low income, black, low income background, Haitian American descent person. And in the community that I come from, there's that sense of like, I'm trying to get my bills paid. I don't care about the environment right now, little bro. And it's like. And so, right. It's like speaking to their values. And then in particular, like what they had mentioned to me, like in terms like, okay, what do you do? Is like emphasizing like these are tactics. So it's like emphasizing the tangible improvement to their like, like lived experience. And in terms of Like, I think that that's the, that's the strategy regardless of like finding what their values actually are and then speaking to those like I think Joe had mentioned, like, you have to be able to speak stakeholder. You have to be able to speak like executive, whatever it might be. And with it's like, what do they actually value and then how can we tie that in? And I think with MIT students like this, like, I guess like MIT students, it seems like we've identified like what they care about is career. And so like what you would have to emphasize is pipeline for them and then for nimby's, like the way that he spoke to me, like, like, yeah, I basically said like, hey bro, the people from my background care about like basketball, music and, or selling stuff. Like how do you tell that kid care about the environment? And so similarly, like, and he's like one of the ways he like somewhat stratified. So it's like if that student is more interested in like a blue collar job, like emphasize how there's going to be labor like required to get some of these initiatives like in place. And then also like, if they're more interested in like the academic or like I guess administrative side implement, like emphasize how there's like more of the, I guess like engineering stuff or like I guess policy side that is also going to be involved.",

Okay, actually it's starting to. Tomorrow everybody has to recycle a huge bin every single day like that. That's insane. But it's like starting with very small changes that we can get accustomed to as, you know, our new natural way of life. Then when we get accustomed to it, that's how essentially we'll start to live. Just like how like in places in Asia, like in Singapore or Japan, they're very good about their waste management because people have grown up, like kids have grown up learning not to throw away trash in the streets. They keep their streets very clean. Like in Singapore, they have like this insane. I don't remember anymore, but this really good waste management system going on. And because people are raised to essentially recycle and to manage their waste that way their whole lives when they grow up, they also teach their children the same way.

You can also analyze our conversations that happen here and the breakout groups you weren't a part of. And there's one interesting, I guess, like, extra interesting outcome is that one of the organizers is a game designer, and so she'll take different stories we tell here and make art out of it for us to talk about next week. And so that's kind of her theory of, like, good stories inspire more good stories. And my job today is just to help facilitate you all getting to know each other, which an extra bonus is you'll come in next week and you already know somebody. You won't be a room of strangers. So I hope that feels better. With that said, we have our typical. What's it called? Conversation norms. Yeah, group norms. That's like the word I'm looking for. 5:30pm so as much as you can, keeping other tabs and distractions closed out, it'll be just the four of us talking. And it feels nice to see each other and things like that. Oh, no. If it's easier to call in, you could do that, or you can chat. We can still talk because Zoom always gives you a phone number too. So feel free to use that sometimes it's a little more stable. So that's the one. Cool. So I can tell you hear us and that we'll find a way to communicate. Yeah, allow people to speak for themselves, share the time. Don't talk over each other. Not something that's usually a problem, but nice to stay up front. We're assuming. And yeah, get curious. It's not me interviewing each of you in a row. Then we could just have individual interviews, but this is a group conversation, so ask each other questions, get excited about what each other has experienced, and I think that'll be really interesting. Okay. Guidelines sound. Okay. This is the boring part. And now it gets more interesting. Okay, Our first question is always something a little gentle, nothing too deep. So a good introduction question for this is, what is your first name? And the first time you heard about sustainability or climate issues? Maybe it was from somebody in your life who just brought it up when you were young. Maybe it was from the news, the class you took. If anyone has something they want to start with, go ahead.",

We're pretty used to it, but it's just watching the news and seeing things like, how can we make the concrete in our buildings more sustainable so that we don't waste a lot of money and that it's not a financial burden to rebuild it every year? How can we make, I don't know, evacuation more sustainable? And that's why part of why it matters so much to me, because I see every year there's a way to make less of an impact and make houses better, make evacuation better, so that people are less impacted by something that we can't control. And then there's also a way, I guess, to help stop. Accelerate climate change, which obviously accelerates some of these issues that we're experiencing.

The weather is so bad there and also there is so much pollution. So when I was going to school back in Afghanistan when I was in grade eight, so whenever I went to school, the. Especially during the winter, the weather was so bad. And also there was always these garbage on the street and everything. So then I was, I was thinking that, oh, what if we could have like a green city where like the pollution, there is no pollution, no garbage or anything. So that was the start of searching. So I started. That was the beginning when I started searching about more about pollution and how these garbages are affecting our community, like the environment we were living in. So I started searching about the pollutions, all these garbages, where did they go, how they affect the environment and everything. And that was when I knew about climate change. Although, like pollution might be like a small cause in climate change, but then I saw like in Afghanistan, so the plastic bags and everything that people were using and then putting on the streets, I started learning more about those, how those were affecting the community and everything. So I started searching more and more about these things. So. And that was when I came up with the term climate change. So when I first knew about it, it was. So I was so interested to know more about it, but it was also kind of scary for me. So I started reading more and more about it and I got like a little bit more knowledge about the climate change. So then I started talking about to my friends in school about climate change. I started talking to my family, but then no one was believing me. And I remember there was one time I was talking to this person. So then we started a project which the aim of the project was to let the young generation of Afghanistan know more about climate change and to take small steps, like stop using plastic bags, making paper bags like those were the small steps we were most focused on. And then there was this time we were interviewing people. They were like mostly the older generation of Afghanistan. And then I talked to a person, a man, he was like almost 60 years old or something, and then I talked to him about the climate change and then he started laughing and then he told me that I am making it up. And that was when I was like, so as you know, Afghanistan is a backward country and is affected by climate change so much, although, like we are not contributing to it a lot, but. But in terms of effect, the people, the community would be affected so much by climate change. And I was so disappointed because even people, the people in Afghanistan even don't know what climate change is, but they're affected in so many ways. For instance, in some part of Afghanistan right now, people barely have access to water, but in some parts there are so much flood and everything. And that was when I was like, it is so disappointing. Like they're being affected so much by climate change, but then they think that climate change is a story tale or something. So that was when I first knew about climate change. Everything.",

And that's sort of what we study at the lab is that One of our PIs, Deb, specifically studied back when Twitter was Twitter and not X, he studied how information travels like seven times as fast. If it's upsetting or fake, people are like, this is so weird, or this is so upsetting and corrections and truth travels a lot slower. It's not as exciting. But that's why we have these conversations, because I want to hear about your lives. I don't want to hear a jargon slogan, this, that, and I feel like I understand you three a little better as people. So I appreciate your time it's also brave to hop on a zoom with strangers at 5:30pm so thank you for talking and I can close out this recording and the next meeting I have is totally optional. But on Thursday I'll be teaching our moderators how to support you all, how not to bring their own biases or tell you what they think. They're just there to support you. If you want to learn moderation facilitation skills, you're welcome to come, but you don't have to. So that's all I have for you today.

So it's kind of hard for you all to see at the same time. So kind of like lean in a little bit. So on this, this gives you like an overview of who this person is, including their sustainability interest, which is something we talked about, their political alignment and their like kind of age and profession and there's a little bit of information about them. So we've got George, someone who works at building maintenance. We've got Priya, who I believe is a student with high interest. She does a lot of student stuff. And Thomas, let me do this person as a researcher. Right. Likes the practical side of things. Can anyone volunteer?

And then, and also like for a sustainable future, which is we shouldn't just think about climate change like we have 13 goals. And then when we are thinking about solutions for climate change, I think we have to think of long term and sustainable solutions, like not to impact in a negative way other solutions. For instance, in terms of financial aid, like we have equity in education or education equity. So if we are thinking of like giving less financial aid to the students, up to low income students. And then so again there's this like we are working on climate change, but we are also working against the goal of having equity education for everyone. Because with the financial like financial barriers or like for so many students it's hard to get education without financial aid. And then that would definitely increase the rate of education inequality. So I think having like quick solutions for just like one day would not definitely work. We have to like think, think of more sustainable solutions, put more thought into it. And also I think for long term solutions we definitely need to put time and effort on it.",

So I was wondering what would be the role of MIT in that context? What would MIT do, especially for instance coming from a third world country. Afghanistan is like not contributing to climate change at all. But then there would definitely be so many severe impacts on our people and community. And I was wondering what would MIT like as a rural lead bringing the net zero for the climate change?

So now that we do have a better understanding, I think it is like probably a good idea for developing countries to still be somewhat cautious. But I would say the responsibility of like fixing the climate crisis is much more on those countries that have like, like the United States, Western powers that have like, already benefited from all the like, industrialization that they've gone through. Like, it's now time for a country like the United States to develop technologies that can like, not only bring them net zero, but also like, help to start like pulling back some of the effects of climate change so that other countries are able to like, go through the same level of development and like experience the same benefits.

This is a global problem. And then we need global solutions. Like, we need to have everyone involved because definitely, like, climate change is going to affect every single person here and the Earth, which I think that is why everyone needs to be heard and that it needs to be on the table in discussion. I think it starts from small conversations, maybe here at mit, and then it goes to broader networks, like even within the countries, like citizen assemblies and within the countries. But I think we have to also consider the point that when people, like when we have these kind of assemblies, I think the policies that are. Or the suggestions that are made here, here, I think they shouldn't just be suggestions and then they're all put away and then there is, like, no action. They're just like, how should I say? Like, just assembly where you gather. And then that's gonna be a. I think we have to also think of, like, putting all the suggestions that we get from assemblies, like, putting them in actual action.

And this is the boring part, so I'm going to skip through it a little quickly. There's a few guidelines that you are already following. Your videos are on. You look like you're present and you're listening, which is always helpful for having a zoom discussion. And then the other basic ones are. Guidelines like speak out of your own. Experience, try to share stories, stay curious and ask questions. I always try to make these. Not like I'm interviewing you all one by one and you're going in a row, but like we actually have a fun conversation. I've popped those in the chat. Is everybody okay with those guidelines? And Jesse, I think you're the only person who's experienced this before you or anybody else. Any edits, any additions? Okay, shaking our heads. Okay, I'm going to kick it off and this will make it more comfortable to unmute and talk. So the first question, and I'll put this in the chat too, in case. You like to see it. Please share your first name and a story about when you first heard about sustainability or climate issues. Maybe it's from somebody in your life, maybe it's from something on the news, something you learned in a class. That's the introductory question. Let me take over here. Okay, so my model is that my name is Marina. The first time I heard about sustainability and I'm curious if anybody else had an experience like this. When I was young, my mom used to tell me to turn off the lights, specifically in the basement. And if I keep the lights on, I'm burning the rainforest. Like I'm going to single handedly burn it all down because I left the basement and I turned the lights on for no reason. And so that was my initial association of like, oh, the rainforest is burning. It's my fault. I'm so sorry. So that was my first experience with climate. And I'm not going to call names, I'm just going to say, who wants to go?",

Have any of you ever heard of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or anwr? It was in the news a few months back for oil drilling. It's a very small well, it's not small, but it's a national wildlife refuge way up north in Alaska, where politicians have spent literal decades just doing a tug of war over, can we drill there? Can we not drill there? This is protected land. There's oil there. And in 2021, I believe it was, President Biden suspended all oil drilling in anwr. And then very recently with the Willow project, which you also might have heard of, it was very large in Alaska, because it's in Alaska, and it's a little bit rare for us to have that kind of direct federal program happening, like, so widely and openly and so controversially, but. So I don't know if it would have caught attention in the lower 48. I do believe it was reported on, but, you know, everything's reported on. So. But in Alaska at least, there was a lot of outcry over it when in 2024, President Biden indicated he would allow drilling again. And a lot of people got online, they got angry, and they started finding groups. I believe the Alaska center is a conservation group that was involved. So on an institutional level, people started kind of finding different volunteer organizations to flock towards or, you know, actively supporting it, depending on their view of sustainability and oil as a resource. And just a few days after the most recent election, so I really doubt anyone has heard about this. It was definitely swallowed by the results of election Day. Biden offered up for sale the permits to a much smaller amount of the of the national refuge than was anticipated. So, like, was it an overall Win? No, but it does feel to myself and to. I know a lot of other people that were trying to do something about it on, as an individual supporting an institution, like a bit of a win. So I'm curious if anybody has had this similar experience or any kind of equilateral.",

I don't know, I don't remember the word that they use for it, but like, I think it was structures where they could hold a lot of water. And essentially what was even more alarming was that actually, I think, like last month, if I remember correctly, it might have been last month the LA Fire Department actually predicted that there would be wildfires coming up. So what they did was they were able to fill all of the water tanks back up at where they expected for there to be fires. But in the end we still ran to the issue of not having enough. And even with redirects from other states and from other nearby, nearby reservoirs, we simply just don't have enough rainfall and we don't have enough water to supply the fire department with what they need to fight fires. So it just kind of reminded me of, in terms of there are specific changes that could be made institutionally, but even in this case, where I know that there are a lot of people in LA that I'm hearing from who are telling me that they take definitely blame the government in terms of not doing enough work with preparing for disaster.

I see why it's happening. Given that it's 3:48 and we haven't talked about MIT yet, maybe that'll be the direction which we're wrapping up. We've talked about big global things and MIT is a big global Actor. What would it look like? Because that's what we're going to get to next week. If your campus, for your left here was more sustainable, what changes do you want to see? And the bonus is how do you want to have contributed? Not just like wave a magic wand. I want every building to be green, but maybe something like that. And Sophie and Tia, I feel like I haven't given you all as much of a chance to speak.

And I was like, oh, and he got a private jet to be flown. And I was just reading about how horrible private jets are and just cringing a little bit to myself. I was like, I don't think he would want that. And I know that's really awful for everyone, but it's the norm, so shout out. But we covered a lot and we could cover a lot more if we could just go around maybe popcorn so it goes a little quicker. Is there anything from this conversation that will stick with you going forward this next week as we're off doing our own things? And so, for example, Samantha, I feel like when you talk about the Arctic and preservation, your tone gets a more like your heart is fully in it. Like you really care and you're like, and what you should care too, but you communicate it in a non judgmental way that I really love. So like just that, just hearing your stubborn hopefulness, that sticks with me. I'm going to carry that through with me, but I guess I can pass it to you.

I know it's way more diversified of an issue than that, but that's to me what it. That's what I think of first. That's my instinctive response because so much of our state is built around oil and oil companies and anwar, the Alaska Native Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, sorry, there's a lot of acronyms for different parts of the state is just a huge chunk of natural land for animals and wildlife. And very recently there was a lot of people trying to get the government to open it up for drilling. And it took years, I believe, but like in 2023 or 2024, I think Biden sold some land and gave some leases to oil companies, but far less than he thought than people thought he might or hoped he would in some cases. And so to me, things like that kind of highlight how for a business it has to be kind of a shifting platform of whether or not you're going to have new places to drill. And so I wonder if in the future there will be some way to frame it. As you know, though, you might have government support right now, like running your business like this isn't viable because in four years this place will be empty. And who knows if they'll give you another lease or not or if there'll be places for more leases or not. So like the sun will always be there, you know, like shift a soldier or OTECH or hydropower.

Like, if you're, for example, a Course 6 major, you don't really get sustainability knowledge unless you actively, you know, take the ENS minor or do a UROP for, like, mcse. And so I asked Chris about, like, the feasibility of sort of making that requirement for graduates or for undergrads and stuff, and he did say that it would be very, very, very difficult, which makes sense because it's sort of changing the entire curriculum. But that sort of makes me wonder what. Or if we can change education to have more of an impact. Because, you know, all the panelists said that education has the biggest return on investment.",

I would think that because there's no requirement on when you have to take a gir. We've all heard of people taking biology and chemistry and whatnot their senior years, right? It wouldn't in any way be less of an experience. Certainly there might be more people in the UROP pool with that relevant experience, but it's still an avenue for students to learn that information. I would assume actually that the area that we would want to have more sustainability information implemented would be elementary schools, middle schools, very, very young, while students are still in most states, required to be in class and required to attend public schools. So I imagine that would have to be implemented through what the Department of Education, that kind of thing.

What else is researched? Also, the education roadblock. How can we ensure that we educate both our students and the broader population? And some ideas we had about that was teaching sustainability through a program similar to gtl, if it's GTL or not. And also another further question is how can Massachusetts go clean? How can our power grid go clean? And what can MIT do to collaborate and ensure that that happens as quickly as possible? Yeah. And we emphasized MIT as a leader that inspires others and, and goes down a road and creates a plan and solution that is adaptable to allow other institutions with different resources to replicate our solutions to ensure that we're not just alienating potential solutions to only the places that have the resources like us.

So tomorrow morning, there's going to be a panel of experts who will answer the questions that you and the other groups come up with today. Does that make sense? So what we're going to do is we're going to start by reading a small description of each of the panelists and then so we can get a sense of their areas of expertise. And then we're going to compile a list of questions. And we're going to do this for the first half of the session. Then we're gonna do that activity that I told you where we're going to pull up some, like, profiles of people and opinions that may not be represented here. So any questions? Okay, so we're gonna start by just getting a sense of the panelists tomorrow. And I pulled this up on the screen so that we can all just see it together and we can each take turns. So Leela is not going to be able to make it. So we're going to just jump over her. 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are four other individuals. Do we want to just go in a circle and everybody can read one of these aloud? Would it be more helpful if we read them all, like, just continuously? Or do you want to read and then have a discussion?

And what is the current state of our 2050 net zero efforts? And then would divestment trade off with other financial programs and what are they and why? And then Also how might MIT's environmental policies affect surrounding small businesses? And how can we partner with local businesses for the initiative? Oh, as well as what are the specific.

As an undergrad, she created frameworks for student engagement with campus climate action, especially campus decarbonization. She also advocated for accelerated climate action 2035 instead of 2050 for zero carbon, as well as problem solving technically with students and alumni on how it can be accomplished, for example, with thermal energy networks. So Megan is our first panelist. Then we have Chris Raby. Chris is the Education Program Director at the MIT Solutions Initiative where his main area of research focuses on better understanding and expanding climate justice and sustainability education at MIT and beyond. Chris is also interested in exploring environmental education and community engagement that centers inclusive and anti racist practices and supports students who experience challenging emotions in relation to the climate crisis. Then we have Joe Higgins, who was appointed Vice President for Campus Services and stewardship on November 1, 2019. Higgins provided key leadership in MIT's alliance with Boson Medical center and Post Office Square to enable the construction of an off site utility scale 60 megawatt solar installation through a power purchase agreement. Adding carbon free energy to the grid while offsetting 40% of MIT's electricity purchases. The largest aggregated renewal energy purchase of its kind at the time of formation. It demonstrates a partnership and economic model for organizations of various varying size undertaking climate action efforts. Since Higgins arrived at MIT, the institute has lowered net campus carbon emissions by 15% as of 2022. And the last panelist is Steve Lanu with a focus on climate and energy work. Steve works to develop, promote and Coordinate programs to advance the Institute's commitment to sustainable practices while integrating campus focused research and learning opportunities with MIT's faculty, students and the broader community. Steve serves on several advisory and working committees serving the Institute, the cities of Cambridge and Boston, and his hometown of Winchester. He's an environmental planner by training with over 20 years experience in environmental policy development and program implementation. He holds a bachelor's degree in International Economic Development from Brown University and a master's degree in Environmental Policy and Planning from mit. So, lots of interesting people. I can leave it here in case one of you wants to consult it. So I suggest that we take like five minutes to start writing down some questions that are coming up for you. And they don't have to be perfect. We're going to workshop them so that we can come up with a list at the end of the session. You can work in Paris if you want. You can just brainstorm silently. Whatever. Whatever you feel most comfortable with. I can get you notebooks if you.",

So basically what the tool does is that it analyzes all of the conversation we had in this session, and it will come up with three missing stakeholders that are potentially absent from this conversation.

Priya is an environmental justice advocate working with a nonprofit organization in Cambridge. Originally from India, she witnessed firsthand the effects of environmental pollution on marginalized communities. CREA has dedicated her career to advocating for policies that consider the impact of environmental issues on these communities. She believes MIT's initiatives are crucial, but stresses the importance of including socioeconomic and Racial analyses in the formulation of these policies. Korea sees potential in MIT's research capacity to drive meaningful change, but encourages more transparency, seeing greater engagement with the communities most affected by environmental degradation.",

For butterflies and birds and stuff like that. So that's like when I started getting really involved with sustainability.

I don't know. That was kind of the gist of the conversation. But I feel like in general a lot of people are kind of like doubtful about stuff like recycling and just like trying to do the right thing. And a lot of people seem to think it's like more about just like making yourself feel better about it. Like maybe you're not like enacting change, but it's just like, to make it seem like you're a good person and like, at least trying. And I don't know. I don't want to agree with that because, like, obviously that's very pessimistic. And I would like to think that we're doing something good for the environment and, like, actually trying to make a change. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's basically the gist of what I was thinking, like, while having this conversation. Yeah, I guess it, like, kind of makes me sad, especially because, like, so many things that I've done here have been, like, related to not. Not exactly recycling, but, like, at least like, making some sort of sustainable improvement or like. Like, one thing was about making, like, biodegradable packaging and stuff like that. So I feel like it kind of makes me sad because it's like, I don't want all of this to, like, be for waste, which I don't think it is.

It is definitely a very slow process, which I also think is a very big problem because obviously a lot of times we have a lot of motivation to change our own behaviors and we can control that. But I think a lot of times we lose motivation to push for wider change. During my high school time, I was part of like a. I'm from like the Bay Area in California, which is very big on sustainability and climate change. And I was in like a non profit like organization. We worked with the city of Berkeley to like push for like building electrification and a lot of buildings in Berkeley. And I believe the process started before I joined the organization and it ended my senior year. So like it took at least like four or five years for one city to make some change. So on a national or a global level, it's going to take a long time and a lot of people to be motivated, which I think is a very big barrier because it's hard for one person to be working on just sustainability for a long time, especially if it's not their career focus.",

Well their goal for this year was to make sure there was like composting and food waste like established in all the dorms and especially like the cook for yourself and then eventually like we would get to the ilgs and stuff. But I think like making sure that that was like enacted and like fully functioning, fully running like in all the dining halls and then people actually like knew what to do with it and if all of them obviously had like recycling and trash and you know, just like all the correct bins that should be there to like especially because we have so much food waste and like so much just like general waste with the dining halls and like the takeout and all that stuff. I think that's another thing too. For a little bit we tried to like make reusable utensils available like with green boxes and stuff. So I think that would also be cool to see just I guess in general just like more sustainable practices and better like waste knowledge and like people actually thinking that like recycling matters and not just like oh I'll just like throw my water bottle in the trash or something in my dorm because we don't have a recycling or you don't believe that it works or something. I think like one final thing is also that a lot of people don't know like how to recycle is what I've seen. Like for example one common thing is like paper towels and stuff. A lot of people think they're recyclable I guess because it is paper. But I don't know. I think just like having better recycling knowledge and like more care about it would be great. So yeah, I think like having some small part in that at least would like be great. Especially like if we could do something this semester, like at least getting like all the food waste bins set up and like the cook for yourself. Like, I feel like that would, that would be like a good start at least. Especially like, because I'm gonna graduate this year. So it would be good to like see this program like up and running and like more established and then like in like 50 years to be able to see something maybe like an old website or something like, oh, thanks food waste fighters for, you know, for decreasing like food waste on campus or like setting up some sort of program that like donates the food waste to somewhere.

It's still run on natural gas and other like, like oil or biogas through and combustion turbine, I believe. So I think they recently renovated it so like, to decrease emissions. But in the future I'll be interested and see, like, how can we reduce it further. Is it even possible for us to like, change completely or partially to clean energy just based on, like, how big our campus is, if we have the space for it, et cetera. But that's something I'll be interested in looking into. It'll be cool if somehow I figure out a way to move away from natural gas or oil for the power plant and I find something else. There's a lot of sun on some of these days, so we can use solar or something like that. And then to make a change to move away from, from traditional fuels for our campus.",

We record it so we actually can start using it next week for one of the games we're playing called Analogia. We use some of the stories that are shared here to make fun images. And we find that good stories inspire more good stories. That's what this is for. And it's also for you to start getting to know each other. So when you show up on Thursday, you have a friend in the room and you don't feel like everyone's 20 strangers, but you actually know, you know five other people. So this the way we normally start these. I have my own little script I'm going through. I have basic community norms. So as much as you can, try to keep other tabs and distractions closed because we're on Zoom and I always keep extra tabs open, but it doesn't facilitate great conversations, so we close them as much as possible. Speak for yourselves. Talk about your own experiences. You'll often hear me asking you a follow up question if it's to say, like, what makes you think that? Or what makes you say that? Because I'm just trying to get a story so I can really understand why you think the way you do and not like, sustainability is important or like, I like recycling. Well, when did you first start thinking that? Like, what makes you say that? What makes you, like, have the energy to say that versus just, you know, going on. So other things that are pretty natural, like share the time, don't speak over too many people, stay curious and, you know, ask questions of each other. Because this is not me interviewing you all one at a time. We're in a group so you can bounce off each other, like, ask questions just because you're interested and things like that. How do these guidelines sound? Any edits? Okay, well, that's the boring part. So I'm going to kick us off with some introductions. And the way I do this is with an easier question. So your first name. And I'd love to hear a story about when you first heard about sustainability or climate issues, whether that's years ago or recently. Sometimes it's like a person in your life started talking about climate, something you heard on the news in class. Oh, and we have one more person. You're all good. Everybody else is early. So I was like, oh, I guess this is it. Let me repeat the question for you. We only just started the introductory question, which no one's answered yet is just your first name and the first time you heard about sustainability or climate issues. So if. Go ahead, Douglas.",

My mom, who doesn't really care about sustainability, but she said I didn't turn the lights off and I wasn't in a room using them. Those lights being on would burn down the rainforest. So that was my first memory of, okay, rainforests are burning. It's my fault. But it sounds like from other people's stories, it's more like excitement and, like, opportunity, and I want to get involved. I can recycle. That's like, the themes I'm hearing so far. My first real question of the day is to get deeper into those feelings. How do you feel when sustainability issues are discussed either by your friends, your family, or the media?

Like, would we do it ourselves for three days? See, on that note, it's almost 6:30. And my last, like, nice question of all these is always just to go around and share a word or an image or a thought that somebody else shared that you're going to be taking with you for the next week or so. It's a nice time to feel like other people have really heard what you're talking about. Yeah, I guess I'm happy to start. Also, I feel like I work in a group that talks about AI every single day, and I talk about it at the exclusion of sustainability. So it kind of switched something in my brain to hear Doug say, like, well, I don't do sustainability every day, but I do other things that actually do connect. So it just kind of broke down the dichotomy between, like, I do sustainability or I do something else. It's like, well, you could just mesh them and you could think about one while doing the other.

Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation, and I have begun recording. I'm just going to go over some things, just some key ground rules. Just to speak for yourself, and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Stay curious, pause, listen generously, and also stay present. I just want to make sure everyone's onboard with these guidelines, we just shared in the large group, and if there's anything you would like to add or change. Okay, perfect. Now we'll move on to some introductory questions, and to make this conversation a little bit easier, in the beginning, we'll use a modified circle. So we'll start with Jessie, Amy, and then go to Martinez. Please tell me if I got your names right. I'm ... Okay, perfect. We'll just use this modified circle to make things run more smoothly. I also want to mention, you can always pass, and we can come back to you, or if you just don't want to answer that question, you don't have to. Feel no obligation there. We're just going to do a quick round of introductions. So, we're just going to ask if you would share your first name, your gender pronouns if you're comfortable doing so, and also, in addition, just share a little bit of background info about who you are and a value that's important to you. I'll go first. My name's Anna. My pronouns are she, her, hers. A value that's important to me is honesty. I really value people being honest and wanting to share their ... Just what they think. I think it just makes it a lot easier and a lot better. This value relates to the community and why I'm here today, because where would I be if people weren't honest? I feel like you can only get so far, and if people aren't truthful, then you're just being held back in the past, and you're not really present, in the moment. With that, I 'll pass it to Jessie.",

If it was utopian downtown Madison, what it would look like. Some of the things that have come up, from just within the in group, is places where young professionals of color, where they typically congregate. We need different types of food venues downtown. We need different areas where Black women and young Black men can get their hair cut, or get it done at a salon. We need those comfortable spaces that normally exist within metropolitan, of Black folks and young people of color, where you might see in Chicago or Atlanta, Dallas, things of that sort, but not just here. It's just not here in Madison. So some of those small things, some of those cultural things, because culture is a meaning and people together. If we have all these people and they don't have a common understanding, there can be no culture, so we're looking to create a culture and craft a new vision for what it means to be a part of this community, and be a young person of color. Do you have the things downtown that signify, and are sign posts, for you to be comfortable in that environment? If you see a country club, you might think of a certain profile of a person that's going to be comfortable in that space, versus seeing a youth center or a skating rink, and some Black restaurant food nearby. So we have to create those spaces for people to coexist, and build, and feel safe. It happens in other parts of the country, it's just not happening here, just yet. But we're on the precipice of change right now. So yeah, I'm excited. I'm definitely excited for folks like Jessie to be back in this environment, for innovative thinkers like Amy, who's been around for a while, to think about how we can make this even better.",

Only the audio recording will be saved, and I just wanted to thank you so much again, for joining us and sharing your thoughts. I'm going to put this in the chat quickly, before they close all the breakout rooms. If you could please fill that out, that would be great.",

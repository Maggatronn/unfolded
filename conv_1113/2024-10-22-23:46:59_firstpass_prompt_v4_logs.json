So, we're just going to ask if you would share your first name, your gender pronouns if you're comfortable doing so, and also, in addition, just share a little bit of background info about who you are and a value that's important to you. I'll go first. My name's Anna. My pronouns are she, her, hers. A value that's important to me is honesty. I really value people being honest and wanting to share their ... Just what they think. I think it just makes it a lot easier and a lot better. This value relates to the community and why I'm here today, because where would I be if people weren't honest? I feel like you can only get so far, and if people aren't truthful, then you're just being held back in the past, and you're not really present, in the moment. With that, I 'll pass it to Jessie."

Even though at our school, it's the, who we create when they leave our walls, that we aspire to. Because we just ... Our diversity is we have 20 children who identify as Black in this building, and that may be multi-racial Black, as African-American being one of the indicators. So we aspire to create strong individuals, as they leave our system, who are those global citizens. I don't know that, that same growth mindset was pervasive in Madison. I feel like ... And that's my experience, and the schools where I experienced. There were some schools that I have been touched by, as somebody whose been out of the classroom supporting schools, that have growth mindset. But some ... I was just ... I'm blown away by the growth mindset out here in the suburbs, I have to tell you. That's kind of what I'm saying.

I think there's a lack of engagement beyond the campus environment, for people to get acclimated to the city, and to the community, so they see it as a viable option when they graduate. That's kind of a little bit of brain drain, that I see here in Madison, when it comes to, specifically young, Black professionals, and young millennials of color, who are all different races and backgrounds, but who just don't feel the vibe, and don't feel the connection to the city, beyond the campus.

So as you're speaking, Martinez, I got to know community, and when I got to know community, I felt compelled to stick around, and not return home to Chicago. But I did that through volunteering, and then I did that through gainful, after school employment. So I appreciate your thinking through how to get people to stick around, especially so that people do see Black and Brown faces as leaders and viable community members, doing what our city needs, which is just good work. One of the things that you said, Jessie, at the beginning, was the idea of root causes stuck with you, when Anna prompted us. And then, in your next sharing, you shared that you fled. So, at some point, it'd be interesting to unpack what root causes pushed you to ... It sounds like you fled, like you got on out of here. Right? But then, here you are. So what next, for us? Not for you, for us."

We need different areas where Black women and young Black men can get their hair cut, or get it done at a salon.

Some of the things that have come up, from just within the in group, is places where young professionals of color, where they typically congregate. We need different types of food venues downtown. We need different areas where Black women and young Black men can get their hair cut, or get it done at a salon. We need those comfortable spaces that normally exist within metropolitan, of Black folks and young people of color, where you might see in Chicago or Atlanta, Dallas, things of that sort, but not just here.

Some of the things that have come up, from just within the in group, is places where young professionals of color, where they typically congregate. We need different types of food venues downtown. We need different areas where Black women and young Black men can get their hair cut, or get it done at a salon. We need those comfortable spaces that normally exist within metropolitan, of Black folks and young people of color, where you might see in Chicago or Atlanta, Dallas, things of that sort, but not just here.

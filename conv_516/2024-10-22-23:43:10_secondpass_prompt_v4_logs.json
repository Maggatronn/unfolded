I had no idea what was on when I walked in the inside, and I saw how the teachers are having to go through different things and not having the support, 30 kids in a classroom, one teacher, no other support, and five of them have an IEP, or 10 of them have an IEP, and she's expected to monitor these children as well as teach the other 20.

There was nobody there to really support me, and they kept telling me all these different things, that they wanted to put my child on medication and everything. It wasn't working for me, I was like, there's got to be another way, other than to have a child constantly on medication and walking through life looking, in my opinion, looking like a zombie. I became very interested in advocating for parents who didn't know any better, and that's what I do now. I actually advocate with parents and help parents to go in and help teachers. But the real thing that helped me and my moment that made me know that I made a difference is when I started doing this work, I went on the other side of the door, because I can tell you what happens as a parent when I'm outside of the school. I had no idea what was on when I walked in the inside, and I saw how the teachers are having to go through different things and not having the support, 30 kids in a classroom, one teacher, no other support, and five of them have an IEP, or 10 of them have an IEP, and she's expected to monitor these children as well as teach the other 20. It's not happening. And if it is happening, it's not happening in an efficient manner. What I do is I help parents to go into the classroom to support the teacher, and one parent came to me, who had two children that had an IEP, and she thanked me, and she said, \\\"You don't know, I didn't understand, before I came here. You don't know what a difference it makes for me to actually understand how important it is for me to be in here with this teacher and to help this teacher and to help this teacher with, even the other children,\\\" because once my parents go into the classrooms, they tend to have a whole different aspect of what the school system is really about, and they fall in love with the kids, and the kids, again, enrich them. They come back and they say, \\\"Thank you for giving me this opportunity. You made a difference. Thank you for letting me understand what really goes on,\\\" because we have a lot of parents that will complain on the outside of the school door, but they never bother to get involved. They never bother to see what's really happening. They never bother to see is it that the teacher just really doesn't want to get back to me, or the fact that she is so overwhelmed she can't. That's happening in our schools, in our community, but if you go up north, there's all kinds of teachers' aides, and there's such an inequity.

That's a whole, well, thank you for the work that you're doing with parents, because they need you. I guess my story is, I don't know, sometimes I wake up and think I'm not making a difference most mornings. There's been a couple times where, and the one that I'll share is one of my last public school positions, I have worked for CPS. I still work in CPS now, as a community partner, but I was up at Evanston Township High School, where I was for about six years, and I was a district-wide administrator. I was their first literacy coordinator, so it was about how do you get reading achievement up on a high school level? I was brought in to solve that big huge problem, and it was tough. But the one thing I will say that I was able to do was get every teacher and every department to know that they had to give kids reading strategies in order to, what am I trying to say? Deal with the content. To access the content. Because if you can't read, it doesn't matter what it says in your science book, because you can't read. You might know how a cell works in your head, but if you can't read it, you can't take the test. If you can't take the test, you know the story. I was able to do that, so integrate reading strategies in every content area, and we detracked humanities, which is English, social studies, and then, eventually, freshman biology. If you know how tracking works, kids take a test, and they get placed in a certain class based on that score, and they're in that track that whole four years. You can't get out of it, no matter if you got straight As the whole time you were there. If you get placed in a lower level class, you can never take an honors class, you can never take an AP class, because you're in that track. What we did was we got rid of tracking for those subjects for freshmen, so that, when they were initially placed, if they were able to achieve, then they were able to move up by just merit alone, and they were able to access honors classes and AP classes, and I was very happy about that, because you don't get into the good universities unless you have honors or AP, period. I found that out with my own kids. When we were going to school, it was like, have a good admissions essay, have some decent grades, and get a decent ACT score, right? But now you can have pretty much a top ACT or SAT, you can have a great essay, but if you do not have honors or AP, they don't consider it a college prep curriculum, and you do not have access to those top tier schools. That's the new gatekeeper, it's the AP and honors. Tell your parents that. When they go to high school, make sure they have honors or AP, it doesn't matter. My kid went to St. Rita, and he took three years of science, three years of math, two years of Latin. You know what I mean, I'm like, okay. And he got turned down by DePaul, Loyola, and it was another one, exactly. I'm just like, \\\"Wait a second. What is happening?\\\" But one guy at DePaul finally told me, and I was frustrated, as a parent, my kid is crying every night because he can't get into a college, that that was a new gate.

We know this is a depressing issue before us as a nation, and we are already gearing up for two other events of huge consequence for us in 2020, before this hit, the election and the census. We're here today in light of COVID to reflect on what matters most as it will be reflected in the census and the election. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but I hope this will be a time for some back and forth among us as we share our stories. For the next part of the conversation, we'll move from the format of taking turns speaking to a more natural back and forth conversation. I think we're pretty much there. I'd invite you to respond to the points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So, first question: what strength has COVID-19 revealed or uncovered about your community or neighborhood? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better.

I speak to the gentleman all the time, we wave or whatever, but he was like, \\\"Hey, look, I just want to share this with you, because I know you have kids.\\\" He didn't see me leaving out to go to work anymore.

He just thought, \\\"Okay, you might need some help.\\\" Stepped up to give me that help and to offer that help. Originally, my parents are from down south, and down south, that's what you did. You helped your neighbor. Everybody in the neighborhood ate. If you had something to eat, you made sure your neighbor had something to eat. That mentality has come back because of COVID-19.

She has appendicitis, she has to have surgery.\\\" I was so fearful. So I understand how those people are feeling. I don't want to go out there, because I'm putting myself at risk, but if I stay at home, I'm still putting myself at risk, so it's a situation they, excuse my French, but I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if don't. The thing with that is I don't know what the solution is. I wish I had a solution. I think you need to take care of yourself. I think you need to put a mask on and take the chances, but if it's a situation similar to what Laurie was saying, then you go in and you have the residents taking care of me. They don't know how to take care of me anyway, so I've now put myself at risk for no reason.\"\n}\n\n**Speaker Turn 2:**\n{\n  \"speaker_turn\": 76,\n  \"speaker_name\": \"Regina\",\n  \"words\": \"First of all, I want to say thank you guys for participating in this conversation.

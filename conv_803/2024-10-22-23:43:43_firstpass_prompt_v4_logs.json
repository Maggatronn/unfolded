A little bit about your background, who you are, where you live, what you do, stuff like that and then a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. I'll just do a quick example of that. My name is Alia, I am the Chief Programs Officer with the Foundation for Black Women's Wellness. I live in Sun Prairie, which is the city right outside of Madison and Wisconsin. A value that is important to me that I want to bring into today's conversation is honesty. I'm really excited for an honest conversation about the state of black women's health here in Wisconsin. We'll go in an order.

Yeah, I have a question, and that is, tell me about a time when you felt healthiest in your life and what were some of the things that were in place that supported you to feel that way? For example, time I felt most healthy in my life was last year. I was in tip-top health, both mentally and emotionally and the things that were in place for me during that time, I can remember I had a great job, good benefits, good health benefits. I had financial support to be able to go to the gym and make sure I was really prioritizing my health. I have a great group of friends, a great social network that is definitely necessary living here in Madison, so that would be my story, that's an example. Anybody feel free to go."

Why is my stomach hurting like this. Why is my menstrual heavy like this? Why does it feel like I'm giving birth every month? It's just crazy that it took that long for me to switch my doctors and say, \"I'm no longer talking to you because I'm telling you exactly what's wrong with me and you are the doctor, not me, you have to figure it out. I'm telling you what's wrong.\" It took me to switch my doctors, and my doctor did one exam and sent me to a specialist and figured out what was wrong with me. Being it took so long and I was in so much pain I had to get a partial hysterectomy. That might have not happened if my doctor actually listened to me and listened to everything that I was telling him that was really wrong with me and not just shooing it off like, \"Oh here we go, here's another stomach problem, here's another pain, here take this medicine and be on your way.\" Just actually listening. Listening to if we say something, that's what it is and it's not to be taken lightly."

Why is my stomach hurting like this. Why is my menstrual heavy like this? Why does it feel like I'm giving birth every month? It's just crazy that it took that long for me to switch my doctors and say, \\\"I'm no longer talking to you because I'm telling you exactly what's wrong with me and you are the doctor, not me, you have to figure it out. I'm telling you what's wrong.\\\" It took me to switch my doctors, and my doctor did one exam and sent me to a specialist and figured out what was wrong with me. Being it took so long and I was in so much pain I had to get a partial hysterectomy. That might have not happened if my doctor actually listened to me and listened to everything that I was telling him that was really wrong with me and not just shooing it off like, \\\"Oh here we go, here's another stomach problem, here's another pain, here take this medicine and be on your way.\\\" Just actually listening.

Then I went to my doctor, I think it was a week later. She was like, \\\"Oh, no, everything is fine.\\\" I ended up going to the E.R. one night just because the pain was so bad, it was in a weird place and so. They did the test where they test your HCG and it's supposed to double every 24 hours, whatever. It was double, and said \\\"Oh no, you're fine. I'm like \\\"No, I need an ultrasound.\\\" Something is not right. Finally, I got ultrasound a couple days later and they found that I was pregnant with twins and one of the eggs or whatever embryos was in my fallopian tube and it was on the verge of exploding, so I had to have an emergency DNC to get it out. The thing was it took two weeks. I switched doctors after that. It was crazy because my doctor's like, \\\"Oh no, you're fine, don't worry about it.\\\" I'm like, \\\"No, this is my third pregnancy. I know something is wrong,\\\" but they just don't believe you. I think especially with black women, there's this notion of, and there's studies that have proved this, that they think that we have a higher pain tolerance or we're out to get some sort of drug or something and so we're faking this. It's just very frustrating because I could have died and there have many women that have died as a result of something similar because the healthcare provider's not listening. I also think there's this misconception that in Wisconsin that the reason why the infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are high is because something about lack of healthcare. It's not about the lack of healthcare. We all have access to healthcare. It's just when we go to the healthcare providers, we're not listened to. Then that prevents people from going because if the doctor's not listening to you, you're not going to want to go back, and then that's why we don't get care.

I feel like most black women have a story about not being listened to. More recently I had a problem with my wrist. It just was in a lot of pain. I thought it was sprained or broken because it was just that much pain and I went to my primary healthcare provider and she ordered X-rays and it wasn't broken or sprained, but it was still in so much pain. I went to a specialist and she was just like, \\\"Oh, it's nothing, it's not really that big of a deal. Just wrap it, wear a brace for a couple months and you'll be fine.\\\" I was just kind of like, \\\"Well, this is a lot of pain. This doesn't feel like it's going to be fine, but I'll wear the brace and I'll do what you said.\\\" I wear the brace for two months all the time. It did not help at all. I just was kind of afraid to go back to that specialist or just my provider because I don't know what's going on with my wrist, but they weren't offering any type of assistance until last month I finally switched doctors and he just said \\\"Yeah, we're not going to go back to her, we're going to get someone that can listen to you.\\\" We found out what the issue was and now it's completely better.

Then, the other piece both Shaquota and April hit on which is the division that's here in Madison and how we as a community should come together. I think it's also important to understand that it's structured that way because white people want it to be that way. Right, if you're giving one person a dollar, another person 50 cents, then you'll scrabble who's going to get the most money and funding. I think once we all realize that, and I think a lot of us talk about it. It's interesting because I feel like everybody in their circles are talking about it. But at the same time, you have your missions, you're trying to ... Everybody's mission is important and is meeting a need and so I think that's what hard, Is just because it's like your mission is meeting a need. Then, I guess people may feel like if they do come together once again, they're going to get less than, right. I think just speaking for myself, I've been in this community for 12 years. I think I mean the most I've been active in the community is within this last year, maybe two years. That's telling because when I first came, I did try and go, not try, but I went to some of the black networking events. You feel it. Right? 12 years ago when I came I felt like there were these cliques, and I didn't fit in and I did not fit in. Educated or not, I wasn't from here, I'd only been here a little bit of time. I hadn't put in the work. Over time people, yes, got to know me, but then personally my lie began to change and I had a family. I wasn't coming out. It was homework, take care of baby. Now she's older and I'm trying to get back out. A lot of it too is my role. It's allowed me a little bit more flexibility in the community that I work with, they're older. But at the same time it's like there's a missed opportunity personally. I could have made an effort, but at the same time individuals who are in position to make that outreach didn't. I think really making sure that those people that are in positions and not ... What I felt is how some of my alumni feel when they go to white events. They go to a chapter and they're being told, \"Oh, are you catering?\" Right? It's just a cycle of how we all do it. White people do it to us, we do it to our own people. Right, and so until we understand. Going back to ... It's a lot of things that others said, it's self-love, self-care, just networking, connecting, uplifting, it's just all important. It's like, where do you start? You don't finish. It's a continuation. I think that that's what people are ... It's like, \"Okay, we started it, now we're done.\" Then, we dropped the ball.

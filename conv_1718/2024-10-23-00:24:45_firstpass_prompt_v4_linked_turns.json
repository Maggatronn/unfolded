    "words": "All right. So we're going to go ahead and get started here. And if the other person joins us in another moment or so, I will just leave space for them to do the introduction and repeat myself a bit. But welcome everyone, I'm so glad to have you here. My name is Adrienne, and this is a conversation for the city of Cambridge. We're working with a partner called Cortico and their local voice network, to record these conversations. And the video of this conversation will be discarded, but the recording will become part of a public collection, the audio, a public collection for the local voice network platform, and shared with the city council and the mayor's office directly. The Cambridge City Council has launched a community engagement phase of the search for the new city manager. And that city manager will start in the summer of 2022. If you're wondering what the city manager does, they are responsible for providing leadership and making financial decisions for all city departments and services. And our city manager recommends policies and programs to the city council, and implements the city council legislation. The office connects directly with Cambridge residents, hosting neighborhood meetings and responding to inquiries and requests. Always working closely with city council to improve quality of life in our community. As Cambridge moves forward in this important process, we need a media input from the Cambridge ... The broader public. Because that's going to have an impact on the lives of people in our city. And we want to be really intentional and thorough to make sure that we're collecting feedback, and we're collecting it in many different ways including surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This conversation isn't any of that, it's not a survey, it's not an interview, it's not a focus group. It's an invitation, an open invitation for you to share your personal experience, and provide us with a perspective on how the city manager process could affect the lives of Cambridge residents. So we're asking for your honest input and perspective, we're thanking you for joining us. And before I begin like a flight attendant, I need you all to verbally consent to the fact that as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to the city of Cambridge to use this recording in accordance with its mission. And you understand that the conversation will become part of the Local Voices Network collection, whose mission is to foster conversation and communities and in the media, to improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. If you understand and agree with this, I would ask you verbally say, \"I agree.\"",

The first is to speak for yourself and ... Of your own experience. Allow others to speak for themselves, share time and allow others to finish speaking, taking turns. Stay curious and ask honest questions. Pause to take time for reflections. Listen generously, so assume good intentions, but recognize that your words have an impact. And when possible, try to close other unnecessary programs, applications, or notifications on your phone for the duration of this conversation. We have 90 minutes set aside. Is everyone on board with these guidelines, or is there anything that you'd like to add or change? All right. I'm going to take the silence as we're all on board with these guidelines. And to ease this conversation, we're going to use a modified circle process. Which means we're going to go in order to share for the first couple of questions. And I'm putting that order in the chat, and I will also say it out loud for anyone who is on the phone. Let me put that in the chat now, hopefully all can see that. So the order we're going to go in is, Sofia, Sarah with an H, Sarah, Halima, Anais and Grace. And I apologize if I've said anyone's name incorrectly, you'll have a chance to introduce yourself in a moment. I would like you to quickly go around say your first name, and then share a little bit about yourself, your background, like where you live or what your interest is, and why you are here today. So a value as it relates to why you are part of the conversation today. And just to ease everyone in doing that, I will start. Like I said, welcome everyone. My name is Adrienne. I am Mayor Siddiqui's constituent support manager. So I hear from constituents and residents in Cambridge all day long. I live in East Cambridge, and an important value for me that relates to this process is that ... And what I get to do in my job every day, is ensure that everyone's treated with dignity and respect by those in public power. So I get to do that by being the first stop for people who want to talk to the mayor, and by being involved in this process. And so I will pass the baton onto Sofia.",

Not every child has that resources to have parents that can have a conversation of feminine hygiene or conversations like that that aren't necessarily you can feel comfortable having them with everyone. So maybe implementing those classes in middle school. I know I had a couple but they weren't in depth, and they really weren't considered a really safe space to get your questions answered. Also kids don't feel like they have to go out of their way to ask what could be an embarrassing question. And then two, I did a lot of equity work recently in the beginning of the year, I ran the equity summit with a couple other of my friends. And a lot of things that came up was, changing curriculums into a more diverse perspective rather than a more white perspective, especially with history. And then also incorporating more books with students that ... Or represent ... Books that have more representation again for all students, mainly in middle and elementary school. I guess it engages students more seeing representation of someone they see in their literature. So I just think those two. Those two have come up recently and I think they're both pretty important.",

Because that's been a huge issue among students of not knowing who to go to when something is happening, and how to ... What the process is and things like that. And then I think the second one would be the school to prison pipeline that we have, and the whole extension school. Just because there has been an issue of extra security in the hallways, and that whole thing of anti-bias training and ...

So I think it's really important when instead of speaking for students, they have students speak for themselves. So I think that's been really something that Cambridge has done really well on.",

Or even sometimes the council wants to do something and the city manager all by themselves just are able to say no. So I know this isn't necessarily the aspect of the person, because it's more of the integrated role itself. But I do think it would be a lot more beneficial if some of this power was given to the city council or school committee, especially when a lot of the motions are related to school specific aspects.

    "words": "Yeah. Thank you Anise. I think that's something that's been reflected in a lot of the conversations that I've had so far. The city council hires the city manager to be the lead administrator for the city and in charge of all the city agencies. And so while the city manager is tasked with executing the city council legislation, there are ... They have the final say in a lot of matters, budgetary specifically among other things. Part of the reason that that was put into place was to avoid politics, essentially interfering in corruption. So this person isn't elected, which means that ideally they wouldn't be responding to corporate money in the same way that a politician could be. However, then you face the less democratic person that wasn't elected making the decisions in the city. And so there's a balancing act there. And Cambridge is unique in the way that this is executed, like a hired CEO that responds to the board. So that's I think really helpful to hear your perspective on that. All right. Well, if somebody wants to come back to this at a later point, we are welcome to do so. I will pose some other questions for you. One is, I would like us to imagine our ideal city manager together, and collectively share some of the key traits and skills that that person would have. The job description is written and that's determined by the charter that can't be changed. But are there specific skills and traits that you want the next city manager to have? Is one question. And the other question ... And I'll put these in the chat as soon as I say them is, what do you hope is different in our Cambridge community five years from now, once the city manager has had time in their position? So I'm going to just mute myself to type these into the chat, and feel free to chime in as you're ready.
